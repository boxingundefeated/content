I have been using Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water for quite some time now and it has quickly become my go-to choice for bottled water. The source of this water comes from a natural spring in Iceland, which is known for its clean and unspoiled environment. The taste of this water is incredibly refreshing, with a subtle sweetness that sets it apart from other bottled waters. 

One of the things that I love about this water is its high alkalinity, with a pH of 8.4. This makes it an excellent choice for people who are looking to maintain a healthy acid-alkaline balance in their bodies. Additionally, the water is free of heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other impurities, making it a very pure option. 

Another great thing about Icelandic Glacial is its commitment to sustainability. The bottles and boxes are made from recycled materials, and the company has been certified as carbon neutral for both its products and operations. This makes it an excellent choice for environmentally-conscious consumers. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this water. Some users have reported inconsistencies in the taste and quality of the water, particularly when ordering online. Additionally, the water can be difficult to find in some areas, which makes it hard for some people to access regularly. 

Overall, I love using Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water as my primary source of hydration. Its refreshing taste, high alkalinity, and commitment to sustainability make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality bottled water option. 


### [NESTLE PURE LIFE Orange Splash Water Beverage - 6 Pack, 16.9 oz Bottles](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/16-9-oz-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/16-9-oz-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="splash-blast-water-beverage-mandarin-orange-flavor-6-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/splash-blast-water-beverage-mandarin-orange-flavor-6-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have been using these Mandarin Orange Splash NESTLE PURE LIFE beverages for some time now and believe me, they are a game-changer when it comes to staying hydrated. I particularly love the burst of fresh citrus flavor that comes with every sip, making it almost feel like I'm sipping on a mandarin orange juice rather than just plain water. 

One of the standout features of these drinks for me is the fact that they contain zero-calorie sweeteners. This means that I can enjoy them guilt-free, knowing that I am not consuming any unnecessary extra calories. Plus, their light sweetness and natural fruit flavors make them a smart alternative to sugary beverages. 

However, as with any product, there are always a few drawbacks. In this case, I find the 16.9-ounce plastic bottles to be a little too convenient. While they are perfect for taking to work or school, I sometimes find myself going through them too quickly and not remembering to refill until it's too late. 

Overall, I would highly recommend these NESTLE PURE LIFE Splash beverages to anyone looking for a refreshing and healthy way to stay hydrated throughout the day. If you're tired of plain old water and want something that tastes great without sacrificing your health goals, then this is definitely the product for you.
