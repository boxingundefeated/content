### [Vinyl Coated Kettlebell from Philosophy Gym - 25 lbs](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/25-lb-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/25-lb-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weight-25-lbs-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/philosophy-gym-vinyl-coated-cast-iron-kettlebell-weight-25-lbs-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I picked up a 25lb vinyl coated kettlebell from Philosophy Gym to spice up my workout routine, and boy am I glad I did! The solid cast iron construction of this kettlebell gives me a sense of stability and assurance that it won't break or chip easily. The vinyl coating is not just for a pop of color - it also protects my flooring and reduces the noise when I'm swinging the kettlebell in my garage gym. 

One of my favorite features about this kettlebell is the wide handle. It allows me to grip confidently whether I'm using one hand or two. Plus, the flat bottom design not only stabilizes the kettlebell on the ground but also makes it so easy to put aside when I'm taking a break. And did I mention how easy it is to identify the weight? The clear labeling helps me keep my sets on track without needing to take a break to figure out which kettlebell is which. 

However, I do wish the box it came in was a little less conspicuous. I ended up ordering this as a surprise gift and was disappointed when I found out that the title of the product was printed right on the box! So for anyone looking to give this as a sneaky surprise, you might want to be prepared for a spoiler. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my decision to add this vinyl coated kettlebell to my fitness collection. It's well-built, versatile, and helps me diversify my workout routine. If you're in the market for a high-quality kettlebell, you won't go wrong with this one from Philosophy Gym!

### [Bintiva 25lb Vinyl-Coated Iron Kettlebell For Stability](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/25-lb-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/25-lb-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="bintiva-professional-grade-vinyl-coated-solid-cast-iron-kettlebells-dark-green-25lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bintiva-professional-grade-vinyl-coated-solid-cast-iron-kettlebells-dark-green-25lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast, I was excited to try out Bintiva's Professional Grade Vinyl Coated Solid Cast Iron Kettlebells (Dark Green/25lb). From the moment I picked up one of these kettlebells, I knew I was dealing with a high-quality product. The protective vinyl coating not only made it safe for both me and the floor beneath, but it also added an appealing pop of color. 

What stood out most was the special protective bottom. It ensured stability and safety during my intense workout sessions, giving me peace of mind knowing that I wouldn't accidentally hurt myself or damage anything around me. 

I also appreciated how easy it was to identify different weights due to the color-coding system. There's no guesswork involved - just pick up the color that matches your desired weight. 

However, there's one thing I didn't quite enjoy about this product. The handle isn't coated with vinyl like the rest of the kettlebell. While this prevents stickiness, it can sometimes lead to a slippery grip, especially during sweaty workout sessions. 

In conclusion, Bintiva's Professional Grade Vinyl Coated Solid Cast Iron Kettlebells (Dark Green/25lb) are well-made and durable tools perfect for any fitness aficionado looking to add variety and challenge to their workout routine. Just remember to keep a firm grip on the uncoated handle!

However, there were a few minor cons to consider.
