### [32oz Owala Flip Water Bottle - Insulated Stainless Steel](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/apana-water-bottle?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/apana-water-bottle?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="owala-flip-water-bottle-very-very-dark-stainless-steel-32oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/owala-flip-water-bottle-very-very-dark-stainless-steel-32oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Owala Flip Water Bottle for a few weeks now, and I must say it's been a game-changer in my daily life. The flip straw makes it super convenient to take quick sips on the go, and the vacuum insulated stainless steel keeps my water icy cold for hours. Even when I fill it up at the beginning of a hot summer day, I can still expect chilled water by the time I'm done with my workout. 

The 32 oz capacity means I don't have to constantly refill throughout the day, which is a huge plus. Plus, the leak-proof lid gives me peace of mind knowing I won't be dealing with any spills in my bag or on my workdesk. 

However, one con I've noticed is that the flip straw can be a little tricky to clean thoroughly. Though the lid is dishwasher safe, I've had to resort to hand-cleaning occasionally to ensure everything stays clean and hygienic. 

All in all, if you're looking for a stylish and functional water bottle to keep you hydrated throughout your day, I would definitely recommend giving the Owala Flip a try! 


### [ReHydration Stainless Bottle - 16oz Onyx Leopard](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/apana-water-bottle?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/apana-water-bottle?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="brümate-rehydration-mini-16oz-onyx-leopard-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/br%C3%BCmate-rehydration-mini-16oz-onyx-leopard-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The ReHydration 16oz water bottle has been a game-changer for me. Firstly, the leak-proof straw lid ensures that I don't have any spills in my bag or car, which is a major plus. The kid-friendly design is perfect for my seven-year-old daughter to take to school, and the cup-holder friendly base allows her to easily carry it around. 

One of the standout features of this bottle is the BEVGUARD TECHNOLOGY, which keeps my drinks ice-cold for 24+ hours without any metallic taste. It's so satisfying to take a sip of cold water anytime, especially on hot days! 

The easy-carry handle is incredibly convenient, and the size of the bottle is perfect for keeping me hydrated throughout the day. I love how durable it is, and the paint on the exterior has held up despite some rough handling from my daughter. 

However, one downside I encountered was the lid. My daughter accidentally chipped the lid while dropping it a few times. I have been waiting for the replacement lids to be back in stock, but it has been quite a while now. I hope to see those available soon, as I believe they are crucial for the overall quality and reliability of the product. 

Overall, the ReHydration 16oz water bottle has been an excellent investment for staying hydrated and reducing our reliance on single-use plastic water bottles.
