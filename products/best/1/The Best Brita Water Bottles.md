### [Brita Fill and Go Vital Water Filter Bottle, Lime, Pack of 1](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="brita-fill-and-go-vital-water-filter-bottle-lime-pack-of-2" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/brita-fill-and-go-vital-water-filter-bottle-lime-pack-of-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Brita Fill and Go Vital Water Filter Bottle in my daily life and it's been a game changer for me. The ability to fill up from any tap and enjoy a pure, refreshing taste of water is just amazing. Plus, each disc lasts for 60 litres of great tasting water, making it an affordable and environmentally-friendly alternative to buying bottled water. 

The 600ml bottle fits most cup holders perfectly, making it ideal for those who are always on the go including car riders, hikers, or travelers. Not only is it practical, but also durable with a bold colorway that adds a touch of style to your outdoor adventures. 

However, the only downside I've noticed is the need to replace the filter disc once it wears out, which can be slightly inconvenient. But overall, this Brita Fill and Go Water Bottle has significantly improved my experience with tap water while reducing my reliance on non-eco-friendly bottled water. 


### [Brita Active Green 0.6L Refurbished D](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="filter-bottle-brita-active-green-06l-refurbished-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/filter-bottle-brita-active-green-06l-refurbished-d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using Brita's Active green water filter bottle for a couple of months now, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer. The first thing you notice about this bottle is its sleek design - it's not only stylish but also compact, making it easy to carry around. The green color adds a nice touch too, especially if you're into eco-friendly items. 

One of the most standout features of this product is its filter system. The MicroDisc fits perfectly into the bottle and effectively removes impurities from tap water, giving you clean and fresh-tasting water wherever you are. I find myself reaching for this bottle more often than my usual reusable water bottle because the taste of the filtered water is just so much better. 

Using the bottle is incredibly easy, even one-handed. Twist off the top, fill up with water, insert the MicroDisc, and twist back on. It's also dishwasher safe, which is a huge plus in my book. I've taken this bottle with me on countless trips to the gym, hikes with friends, and even used it at work. Not once did I experience any leakage or spills, unlike some other water bottles I've tried in the past. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Brita Active does have a couple of minor drawbacks. Firstly, the cap/cup included with the bottle is relatively fragile. Dropping it from waist height onto a solid surface resulted in the cap shattering into pieces - not ideal for those who are prone to accidents. Secondly, the MicroDiscs need to be replaced every few weeks, which can be costly over time. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Brita Active green water filter bottle. It has successfully replaced my usual reusable water bottle and made drinking tap water enjoyable again. While there are some minor issues to consider, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If you're on the market for a reliable and eco-friendly water bottle, look no further than Brita's Active water filter bottle. 


### [Brita Kids' Water Filter Bottle, 380ml, Blue](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="brita-water-filtration-system-kids-bottle-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/brita-water-filtration-system-kids-bottle-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a mom constantly worried about my kids' hydration while on the go, I stumbled upon the Brita Water Filtration System, Kids' Bottle (380ml) in a lovely blue color. It's not just a regular bottle; it features a sports gear design that encourages my little ones to drink more water. 

The first thing I noticed was its compact size - perfect for small hands. Despite being an adult, I found the squeezable grip quite comfortable. Not only does it hold a decent amount of water, but it also keeps us protected from the cost and waste of bottled water. 

One feature that stood out is the built-in filter system. It removes impurities and makes tap water taste great. Plus, it's BPA-free and top-rack dishwasher safe - a win-win in my book! 

However, there's room for improvement. Sometimes, the bottle tends to leak, which can be quite frustrating when you're out and about. Additionally, the cap can be a little hard to pull up. 

Nevertheless, I would recommend the Brita Water Filtration System, Kids' Bottle, to anyone looking for a convenient way to keep their kids hydrated. It's a great addition to our daily routine. 


### [Brita Water Purification Bottle 600ml - Purified Portable Drinking](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="brita-water-purification-bottle-fill-go-with-2-cartridges-600ml-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/brita-water-purification-bottle-fill-go-with-2-cartridges-600ml-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, you must be referring to the Brita Water Purification Bottle, a quirky little number that's as fashionable as it is functional. I've been using this little piece of magic for quite some time now in my daily life. The first thing that caught my eye when I got it, was its vibrant purple colour that just pops and adds a splash of fun to my otherwise mundane hydration routine. But it's not just about the looks with this one. 

The material is a blend of polypropylene and polyethylene, which feels quite solid in my hands. The Tritan resin they've used is tough and doesn't scratch easily, even when I accidentally drop it. This is probably the main selling point for a clumsy like me, who can't seem to keep their belongings safe from harm. The lightweight build also makes it incredibly easy to carry around, whether I'm going to the gym, hiking or just running my errands. 

However, there's a small catch. The water filter capacity is quite limited, to be precise, it's 0.2 gal (0.6 L). Don't get me wrong, it's enough for a quick refill in between meetings or during a workout, but when it comes to long hikes or intense workout sessions, I wish there was more capacity. However, to be fair, this limitation is balanced by the purification function which removes 9 substances including chlorine, benzene, and even organic compounds that affect the taste of your water. 

Now, coming to the reviews from other users, it seems like the general consensus is that the water is indeed purified and tastes great. However, quite a few users have reported issues with the screw cap and the mouthpiece. Some have found it hard to disassemble, while others have had trouble adjusting to the unique design of the mouthpiece. 

I personally haven't encountered any issues with these features, but it does highlight the importance of giving this product a test drive before committing to it entirely. Overall, I'd give the Brita Water Purification Bottle an 8 out of 10. It's not perfect, but it does its job quite well and adds a splash of fun to your daily hydration needs. 


### [Brita Fill&Go Water Filter Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="fillgo-water-filtration-bottle-0-6-l-blue-transparent-1046677" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/fillgo-water-filtration-bottle-0-6-l-blue-transparent-1046677/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Fill&Go Water Filtration Bottle for a while now, and I must say, I'm impressed. Not only does it filter out impurities and odors, but it also manages to hold a generous 0.6 litres of water - perfect for my daily needs. The durable and light construction makes it so easy to carry around, even during my runs. 

However, I will admit that occasionally the bottle tends to become slightly heavy when filled to its maximum capacity. And although the blue-transparent color looks stylish, it may not suit everyone's taste. But overall, I've had a great experience with this bottle. I no longer need to constantly buy bottled water; I just fill up my Fill&Go and I'm good to go! 


### [Berkey Sport Portable Water Filter Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="sport-berkey-filter-water-bottle-22oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sport-berkey-filter-water-bottle-22oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Sport Berkey Filter Water Bottle, and I must say, it has been a game-changer in my daily water intake routine. This 22oz bottle is lightweight and highly portable, making it perfect for staying hydrated during hikes, trips to the gym, or even just long commuting hours at work. 

One of the standout features of this bottle is its purification system. It uses a small yet powerful filter to remove harmful contaminants from various water sources. This means I can fill up from practically anywhere – a stream, pond, or even a questionable water fountain at work – without worrying about any unpleasant tastes or unhealthy chemicals. Plus, the non-leaching, BPA-free construction gives me peace of mind about the quality of the material my water is coming into contact with. 

However, the filter does have a drawback; refilling needs to be done quite often, particularly if you're drinking from untreated sources. Additionally, it can be difficult to take a full draw of water due to the flattened straw and pressure issues mentioned by some reviewers. 

Despite these minor cons, I am overall very satisfied with the Sport Berkey Water Bottle. Its ability to provide clean, great-tasting water on-the-go has significantly improved my hydration habits. If you're looking for a reliable and convenient way to ensure you always have access to safe drinking water, this could be the perfect solution for you. 


### [Berkey Sport Reusable Filtered Water Bottle Set](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="berkey-sport-filtered-water-bottle-bpa-free-portable-22oz-new-2018-model-pack-of-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/berkey-sport-filtered-water-bottle-bpa-free-portable-22oz-new-2018-model-pack-of-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Berkey Sport Filtered Water Bottle and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily hydration routine. This portable, reusable bottle is perfect for travel, exercise, and emergencies. Made from high-quality, BPA-free materials, it ensures that I'm drinking pure, clean water wherever I go. 

One aspect I particularly appreciate is its ability to filter out a broad array of contaminants from tap water or raw, untreated freshwater sources like ponds, rivers, and streams. It's reassuring to know that even when I'm outdoors or in less-than-ideal water conditions, I can trust the Berkey Sport Bottle to keep me hydrated without sacrificing my health. 

However, there have been a few drawbacks that I've noticed. Firstly, the straw is a bit flat, making it difficult to take a full draw. Additionally, the seal on the top of the bottle isn't the tightest, which could result in some spillage. Lastly, it's not the easiest bottle to squeeze, adding a bit of extra effort when drinking from it. 

Despite these minor issues, I've been very satisfied with the overall performance of the Berkey Sport Filtered Water Bottle. Its durability, convenience, and efficiency make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to stay hydrated on the go. 


### [Compatible Brita Water Bottle Filter Replacements](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brita-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

I've been using the Brita Water Filter Replacements for Water Bottles for quite some time now, and let me tell you, they've made a significant difference in my water consumption. Not only do they help me save money, but they also drastically reduce the number of single-use plastic bottles that end up in landfills. 

The first thing that struck me about these filters was how easy they are to install. It took me less than a minute to switch out the old filter for a new one, and I was back to enjoying great-tasting, filtered water in no time. The BPA-free design of the filter is another plus, ensuring that my water stays free from harmful chemicals. 

One of the standout features of these filters is their ability to reduce chlorine taste and odor, as well as other impurities commonly found in tap water. This has made a world of difference in the taste of my drinking water, making it more enjoyable and refreshing to drink. 

However, one minor inconvenience I experienced was the frequency with which I needed to replace the filters. While the product claims that each filter lasts for approximately two months, I found that it began to be difficult to drink through the straw much sooner than that. This resulted in having to replace the filter more frequently than expected, which can become quite costly over time. 

All in all, I would recommend these Brita Water Filter Replacements for Water Bottles to anyone who wants to enjoy clean, great-tasting water on the go while also reducing their impact on the environment. Despite the minor inconvenience of having to replace the filters more frequently than advertised, the convenience, ease of use, and improved water taste make these filters a worthwhile investment.

I've been using the Lifestraw Go Water Filter Bottle, green, while traveling and it's been a game-changer. First of all, its ability to filter water down to 0.2 microns is impressive, providing safe drinking water on-the-go. The activated carbon capsule also reduces chlorine and bad taste and odor, making the water taste much better than it might otherwise. 

The build quality is excellent, with the bottle being both durable and leak-proof. It's made of BPA-free Tritan, which adds to the overall quality of the product. 

However, I did experience some issues. For instance, the filter and mouthpiece can be a bit difficult to clean due to their design, which can lead to some inconvenience. Additionally, the bottle may leak slightly if not handled carefully, which is a minor inconvenience. 

Nonetheless, the fact that it doesn't have any aftertaste or use chemicals or iodine is a major plus, and the inclusion of a carabiner for easy carrying is also a welcome feature.
