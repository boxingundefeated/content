### [Sturdy Yoga Mat Set with Blocks, Towels, and Knee Pad](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-goyoga-7-piece-set-include-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-2-yoga-blocks-yoga-mat-towel-yog-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-goyoga-7-piece-set-include-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-2-yoga-blocks-yoga-mat-towel-yog-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Balancefrom GoYoga 7-Piece Set after seeing it in a roundup review article. The product includes a yoga mat, carrying strap, two yoga blocks, a yoga mat towel, a yoga hand towel, a yoga strap, and a knee pad - everything you need for a comfortable and supported yoga practice right at your fingertips! 

One of the features that stood out to me was the excellent non-slip traction of both the yoga mat and the yoga hand towel. This has greatly reduced the risk of injuries during my yoga sessions, especially during more intense poses. The moisture-resistant technology of the mat has also been a game-changer, making it super easy to clean with just soap and water. 

However, I did find one downside to the product - the carrying strap. While it's a nice touch that it is included, its design is more suited for large items rather than a yoga mat. Despite this, the overall value, comfort, and ease of use of the Balancefrom GoYoga 7-Piece Set have made it a must-have addition to my daily yoga routine. 


### [Extra-thick 10mm Grippiest Yoga Mat with Carry Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat religiously for my daily yoga sessions and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The extra thickness provides unbelievable comfort and support, especially during my intense core workouts. It's like having a personal cushion right beneath me, leaving no room for sore knees or elbows. 

One thing I absolutely adore about this mat is the easy-cinch carrying strap. It makes transporting the mat a breeze, whether I'm throwing it in the car, storing it at home, or bringing it to the gym. Plus, the variety of colors adds a fun, personal touch and keeps things stylish. 

However, there have been a couple of hiccups. Initially, the mat provided excellent grip but as time passed, it started to lose its stickiness, which can be quite frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a challenging yoga sequence. And while it's an excellent choice for a fitness mat, some yoga poses can lead to stretching and potential tearing, making it less ideal for a strictly yoga practice. 

All in all, if you're looking for a comfortable, colorful, and versatile fitness mat that excels at supporting your body during workouts, the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat is definitely worth considering. Just keep in mind that it may not be the best choice for those who heavily rely on their yoga mat's grip for intense sessions. 


### [Exquisite Printed Yoga Mat Mandala for Balanced Practices](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="prosource-5mm-thick-yoga-mat-mandala-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/prosource-5mm-thick-yoga-mat-mandala-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the ProSource Printed Yoga Mat Mandala, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily workout sessions. This mat is designed to provide not just comfort but also style to your yoga practice. The exclusive Mandala design on the mat adds an aesthetic touch to your workout space and inspires you to give your best. 

One of the key features that stood out to me was its thickness. At 5mm, it provides just the right amount of cushioning to support my joints and provide comfort during various poses. And despite its thickness, it's lightweight and easy to carry around, making it perfect for those on-the-go workout sessions. 

The non-slip surface of the mat has also been a boon. It stays in place even during intense yoga practices, ensuring that I don't lose focus due to unnecessary fumbling. Plus, the moisture-resistant coating ensures that the mat remains odor-free and resistant to bacteria. 

However, one thing that could have been improved upon is the material of the mat. While it's made of non-toxic PVC, some users might prefer an eco-friendly alternative like natural rubber or recycled materials. 

Overall, the ProSource Printed Yoga Mat Mandala has been a reliable companion for my daily yoga sessions. Its unique design, comfort, and durability make it an excellent choice for both beginners and advanced yogis alike. 


### [Gaiam Moroccan Inspired 5mm Yoga Mat for Non-Slip Performance](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-printed-marrakesh-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a big fan of Gaiam, I've been using their Printed Marrakesh Yoga Mat for quite some time. It's such a delightful addition to my daily practice. The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful and vibrant medallion pattern that gives an energetic boost to my space. I also appreciate its 5mm thickness, as it provides just the right amount of cushioning and support for my joints during intense postures. Plus, it's latex-free, which is a great plus for earth-conscious yogis like me. 

One noteworthy feature is the mat's non-slip quality. Even during my most intense sessions, I've yet to lose my footing. The craftsmanship is impeccable, and it seems to be durable enough for regular use. However, it did release a strong odor upon unboxing, but I followed the care instructions and it faded away within a few days. 

In conclusion, this colorful mat has definitely been a game-changer for my daily practice. Not only does it provide solid support and comfort, but the eye-catching design also adds a touch of warmth and vibrancy to my space. Even though there might be a small lingering odor initially, following the care instructions will help eliminate that. Overall, I highly recommend this Gaiam yoga mat to anyone looking to add a splash of color and comfort to their practice. 


### [Reversible Yoga Mat with Carry Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="cap-yoga-reversible-yoga-mat-5mm-with-carry-strap-dahlia-ginkgo-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cap-yoga-reversible-yoga-mat-5mm-with-carry-strap-dahlia-ginkgo-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

After being on the lookout for a new yoga mat to enhance my home practice, I came across the CAP Yoga Reversible Yoga Mat. The moment I unrolled it, I knew I had found something special. Featuring a soft, textured surface and 5mm of cushioning, this mat has made my yoga sessions more comfortable and tranquil. 

One of the main highlights of this product is its reversible design. With the choice between a beautiful Dahlia print on a mustard background and a Ginkgo print on a London stone background, this mat truly adds a personal touch to my yoga practice. 

As a yoga enthusiast, I appreciate the portability of the CAP Yoga Mat. Its lightweight design, coupled with the included carry strap, makes it easy to transport to and from classes or simply rolling it up for storage at home. 

However, I did experience a few cons with this product. Some users have reported that the colors slightly differ from the pictures, and the strap may lack durability. Additionally, the thickness of the mat can be perceived as slightly thin for some, though it has worked perfectly fine for me. 

Overall, the CAP Yoga Reversible Yoga Mat is a great addition to anyone's home fitness equipment. Its affordable price, beautiful design, and comfortable feel make it a valuable investment for any yogi. While there are a few minor cons, the pros far outweigh them, making this a highly recommended product. 


### [Yoga Mat for Balance and Comfort, Pink](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-gocloud-1-extra-thick-exercise-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-gocloud-1-extra-thick-exercise-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was in search of a comfortable yoga mat that could cushion my spine, hips, knees, and elbows during my workout sessions. The BalanceFrom GoCloud 1" Extra Thick Exercise Yoga Mat with Carrying Strap has been a game-changer for me. The pink color is quite appealing, and it's even better when I discovered that it's made of a high-density foam that provides excellent support and comfort. 

One of the key features that I absolutely love is the double-sided non-slip surface. This has prevented any accidents or injuries during my workout sessions and has given me the confidence to push myself harder. 

The carrying strap is another brilliant addition to this mat. It makes it super easy for me to transport and store, so I can take it anywhere I go for my workout sessions. 

However, one problem I faced was a minor chemical smell when I first received it. Fortunately, this has dissipated over time. 

In conclusion, the BalanceFrom GoCloud Exercise Yoga Mat has greatly enhanced my workout sessions, providing me with the comfort and safety I need. I would highly recommend this mat to anyone looking to elevate their fitness routine. 


### [Organic Cotton Yoga Mat for Comfort and Portability](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="live-well-360-organic-cotton-yoga-rug-27-x-78-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/live-well-360-organic-cotton-yoga-rug-27-x-78-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Live Well 360 Organic Cotton Yoga Rug for quite some time now, and I must say, it's a game-changer. As a passionate yogi who values both comfort and sustainability, this mat has exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. 

Firstly, the portability of this rug is unmatched. Unlike traditional yoga mats, this rug folds up nice and tight, making it easy to carry around wherever I go. Whether I'm heading to a yoga class or just practicing at home, its compact size ensures it doesn't hog too much space in my bag. Plus, washing it is a breeze - just throw it in the washing machine with cold water and let it air dry. It's always smelling fresh and clean for my next session. 

The softness of the organic cotton is another standout feature. Unlike synthetic mats that can sometimes feel harsh on the skin, this rug provides a comfortable surface that's gentle yet firm. However, I've noticed that it's not as thick as other mats I've used, so if you're looking for extra cushioning, pairing it with a yoga blanket might be a good idea. 

One issue I've experienced is the grip. While it's generally fine on carpeted surfaces, using it on hardwood floors can be a challenge due to its lack of traction. To overcome this, I've started using a non-slip mat underneath it, which has significantly improved its grip and stability during practice. 

In terms of durability, I'm impressed with how well this rug has held up so far. Despite frequent washing, it hasn't shown any signs of wear or shrinkage. Additionally, knowing that my purchase supports ethical and sustainable practices adds an extra layer of satisfaction to my yoga practice. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Live Well 360 Organic Cotton Yoga Rug to anyone seeking a high-quality, eco-friendly mat for their yoga sessions. Its comfort, portability, and ease of use make it an attractive option for both seasoned yogis and beginners alike.

## FAQ


### What is a cloth yoga mat?

A cloth yoga mat is a type of yoga mat made from eco-friendly and breathable fabrics such as cotton or hemp. They provide a comfortable and cushioned surface for practicing yoga, while being gentle on the environment. Unlike traditional rubber or PVC mats, cloth mats are more easily washable and offer a natural, non-slip surface. 


### Why should I choose a cloth yoga mat over a rubber or PVC mat?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cloth+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cloth Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

Cloth yoga mats are environmentally friendly and sustainable, as they are made from natural fibers such as cotton or hemp. They are also more easily washable than rubber or PVC mats, making them a hygienic option. Furthermore, cloth mats provide better breathability compared to rubber or PVC mats, offering a comfortable workout experience. Lastly, they offer a natural, non-slip surface for yoga practice. 


### How do I clean a cloth yoga mat?

Cloth yoga mats can be easily cleaned using a mild detergent or soap and water. Wash the mat gently, rinse thoroughly, and hang it to dry. It is essential to avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach on the mat, as they may damage the fabric or alter its color. For regular maintenance, vacuum the mat or use a fabric brush to remove dust and lint, then spot clean any stains with a moist cloth and mild detergent. 


### What is the difference between a cotton and hemp cloth yoga mat?

Both cotton and hemp are natural fibers and are eco-friendly choices for yoga mats. However, hemp mats have some advantages over cotton mats. Hemp fibers are more durable and long-lasting than cotton fibers, making hemp mats more resistant to wear and tear. Additionally, hemp mats tend to be thicker and more cushioned than cotton mats, offering greater support and comfort during practice. On the other hand, cotton mats are more lightweight and can be easily folded or rolled, making them a convenient choice when traveling. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cloth+Yoga+Mats-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cloth Yoga Mats-5"></a></div>


### How thick should a cloth yoga mat be?

The thickness of a cloth yoga mat generally ranges from 3mm to 6mm. A thickness of 4mm to 5mm is considered ideal for providing adequate cushioning without compromising stability during practice. Thicker mats offer more support and comfort, while thinner mats may be easier to transport and store. Choose a thickness that suits your personal preference and needs for your yoga practice. 


### What is the best way to store a cloth yoga mat?

To maintain the quality and longevity of your cloth yoga mat, it is essential to store it properly. After practice, allow the mat to air dry completely to prevent mold or mildew growth. Once dry, roll the mat up tightly with the fabric side on the outside, and secure with a strap or cord. Store the rolled-up mat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading or damage to the fabric fibers. 


### How do I prevent my cloth yoga mat from slipping during practice?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/cloth-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Cloth+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Cloth Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

To prevent your cloth yoga mat from slipping during practice, consider using a yoga towel or mat liner, especially during hot yoga or sessions involving a lot of sweating. These accessories provide additional grip and help keep the mat dry and secure. You can also lightly mist the surface of the mat with water or apply a small amount of natural stickiness enhancer (such as a mixture of water and essential oils) to improve traction. Lastly, ensure that your hands and feet are clean and dry before practice to maximize grip on the mat. 


### Do cloth yoga mats work well for hot yoga?

Cloth yoga mats can be suitable for hot yoga practices, as they are usually more breathable and lightweight compared to rubber or PVC mats. However, they can become slippery when wet from sweat. To prevent sliding during hot yoga sessions, using a yoga towel or mat liner with a non-slip backing can help keep the mat dry and secure. Additionally, ensure that your hands and feet are clean and dry before practice to maximize grip on the mat. 


### Can I use a cloth yoga mat outdoors?

Cloth yoga mats can be used outdoors, but they are not as durable or moisture-resistant as rubber or PVC mats. Over time, extended exposure to sunlight, moisture, or abrasive surfaces may cause the fabric fibers to degrade or the mat to become stained. To protect your cloth yoga mat from damage while practicing outdoors, consider placing a natural rubber or PVC mat on top of it, or using a yoga towel or mat liner. Additionally, always store your cloth mat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
