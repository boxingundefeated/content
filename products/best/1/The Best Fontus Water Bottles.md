### [Thermos 12oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounce-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounce-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a parent and avid product reviewer, I was excited to try out the Thermos Funtainer Bottle for my kids. We've been using it for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has been a game-changer on hot summer days. The first thing that stood out to me was its design. It's sleek and stylish, with vibrant colors that my kids absolutely love. 

One of the highlights of this bottle is its ability to keep drinks cold for up to 12 hours. I filled it with ice water during a family picnic, and even after several hours, the water was still refreshingly cold. This feature is especially useful for those long days when we're out and about. 

The stainless steel interior and exterior are also worth mentioning. The sturdy construction makes me feel confident that it can withstand the rough and tumble world of a child's daily life. Plus, the built-in carry handle means my kids can easily carry it around without any assistance. 

However, there are a couple of cons to consider. First, the bottle is not suitable for hot liquids, which might be a deal-breaker for some families. Second, while the hygienic push-button lid with pop-up straw is a great idea in theory, it can be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly. 

In summary, the Thermos Funtainer Bottle has proven to be a reliable companion for keeping our drinks cold throughout the day. Its sturdy construction, stylish design, and effective insulation make it a worthwhile investment for families with active kids. Just be aware of its limitations with hot liquids and prepare for some extra effort in cleaning the lid. 


### [1.0L Platypus SoftBottle with Push-Pull Cap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="platypus-softbottle-1-0l-apex-push-pull-cap-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/platypus-softbottle-1-0l-apex-push-pull-cap-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid hiker and traveler, I've tried countless water bottles in search of the perfect companion for my adventures. The Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L has been a game-changer, providing lightweight, collapsible hydration that's both versatile and convenient. 

One of the things I love about the SoftBottle is its unique design. It's not only lightweight and flexible but also packs down small when empty, saving valuable space in my backpack. Its smart design features a narrowed midsection, making it easy to grip even when full. 

Another highlight of this bottle is its compatibility with various Platypus lids and drink tube kits. I use the Push-Pull Cap, which is leak-proof and easy to use on the go. Plus, the bottle materials are taste-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and phthalate-free, ensuring my water stays clean and pure. 

However, there are some downsides to consider. Some users have reported issues with leakiness and durability, with some bottles developing holes or tears over time. While I haven't experienced these problems myself, it's worth keeping in mind that quality may vary from bottle to bottle. 

Despite these cons, the Platypus SoftBottle 1.0L offers a reliable and convenient hydration solution for adventurers. Its lightweight and compact design make it perfect for backpacking, climbing, or commuting, while its compatibility with various lids and drink tube kits adds versatility. With its ease of use and high-quality materials, the SoftBottle is a must-have for anyone on the go. 


### [12 Hour Cold Retention Thermos Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle (Purple)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="thermos-12-ounce-stainless-steel-funtainer-bottle-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-12-ounce-stainless-steel-funtainer-bottle-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a busy mom always on the go, I've become rather picky when it comes to buying bottles and containers for my kids. So, when I found the Thermos 12-Ounce Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle in a bright, inviting shade of purple, I decided to give it a shot. 

One of the things that appealed to me about this bottle was its double wall vacuum insulation, which promises to keep cold beverages icy for up to 12 hours. This proved to be true; even on hot summer days at the park, my children's drinks stayed cold enough for them to enjoy all day long. I also appreciated the hygienic push-button lid with its pop-up straw - it's super easy for my kids to use and even easier for me to clean. 

However, the one downside to this bottle is that it's not designed for hot liquids. If you're looking for a bottle that can handle both hot and cold beverages, this might not be the best option for you. But for everyday use with cold water or juice, the Thermos Funtainer Bottle gets the job done admirably. 

In summary, if you're in the market for a durable, easy-to-use, and child-friendly sports bottle, the Thermos 12-Ounce Stainless Steel Funtainer Bottle is definitely worth considering. With its kid-proof design and impressive temperature retention capabilities, this bottle has quickly become a staple in our household. 


### [Thermos 12 Oz Funtainer Insulated Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounces-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-funtainer-bottle-12-ounces-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The 12-ounce FUNtainer bottle from Genuine Thermos Brand has been my go-to for keeping my beverages cold and refreshing on the go. Its stainless steel interior and exterior, combined with Thermos vacuum insulation technology, ensure that my drinks stay icy for up to 12 hours. The integrated carry handle and hygienic push button lid with a pop-up straw make it super easy to open and drink from, even when I'm on the run. Although it's not meant for use with hot liquids, it's perfect for anyone looking to stay hydrated during their daily adventures. I must admit, the wide range of vibrant colors available for this bottle does make it quite appealing! 

One of the standout features of the FUNtainer bottle is its durability. The unbreakable stainless steel construction can withstand the toughest of conditions, making it an ideal companion for people who love the great outdoors or are always on the move. The bottle's ability to maintain the temperature of my beverages for such a long time is also a huge plus, especially during hot summer days. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks that I must address. Firstly, the bottle's capacity may not be sufficient for some users, as it only holds 350ml of liquid. Secondly, the plastic straw component could use some improvement, as it tends to absorb the taste of the beverage, which can be unpleasant after a while. 

Overall, the 12-ounce FUNtainer bottle from Genuine Thermos Brand is a reliable and functional accessory that has made my life more convenient. Its excellent insulation capabilities, durable construction, and user-friendly design make it a must-have for anyone who values staying hydrated while on the go. While there is room for improvement in terms of capacity and straw quality, these minor issues do not detract from the overall effectiveness and appeal of this product. 


### [Pnw Elements 22 oz. Seafoam Teal Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="pnw-components-elements-water-bottle-seafoam-teal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pnw-components-elements-water-bottle-seafoam-teal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Ever been stuck on a trail, thirsting for a drink of water? Fear not, for the Pnw Components Elements Water Bottle, in its stunning Seafoam Teal color, is here to save the day! With a capacity of 22 oz. , it's perfect for quenching your thirst on long rides or at the gym. 

I personally love the Purist Technology, which keeps the plastic taste at bay and ensures your water always tastes fresh. The Moflow Cap is another gem, making it incredibly easy to open and close with one hand, even when you're on the go. 

However, it's not all sunshine and roses. This bottle isn't insulated, so if you're in hot climates, your water may get warm faster than you'd like. But hey, at least it's not pretending to be something it's not, right? 

All in all, I'd recommend the Pnw Components Elements Water Bottle to anyone looking for a stylish, high-quality bottle that won't break the bank. Just remember to keep it out of intense heat and enjoy the sweet taste of hydration on your next adventure! 


### [Yeti 25 oz Yonder Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/fontus-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="yeti-25-oz-yonder-water-bottle-charcoal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yeti-25-oz-yonder-water-bottle-charcoal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for a lightweight, non-insulated water bottle that can keep up with my daily hydration needs. Enter the Yeti Yonder Water Bottle, a game-changer in the world of water bottles. 

Firstly, its unique design and stylish color options make it an attractive addition to my workout gear. The Yonder's cap is ingeniously designed with a two-part system, making it incredibly easy to drink from and refill or wash. It's 100% leakproof, so I can trust it to stay dry in my bag. 

One aspect that stands out is the bottle's non-insulated construction, which means it's less bulky than traditional thermal bottles. However, this does mean that it may break a sweat in warmer weather, so keep that in mind if you're considering a purchase. 

The Yonder's lightweight nature and ergonomic handle make it perfect for hiking and other outdoor activities. It also fits most cup holders, making it a convenient choice for road trips or commuting. 

Dishwasher safe and easy to clean, the Yonder is a reliable companion for staying hydrated throughout the day. The only downside I've encountered is its lack of insulation, which limits its use for hot or carbonated beverages. 

In summary, the Yeti Yonder Water Bottle is a stylish and functional addition to my daily routine, whether I'm hitting the gym or just trying to drink more water. Its unique design, leakproof cap, and lightweight construction make it a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to stay hydrated in style.
