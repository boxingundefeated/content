### [Gaiam Indigo Point Yoga Mat (6mm)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Gaiam Premium Print Yoga Mat in Indigo Point, and it's been a game-changer for my home practice. The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful design, which features a subtle point print that adds visual interest while also helping me check my alignment during yoga sessions. 

The mat itself is 6mm thick, providing ample cushioning to support joints and maintain proper alignment during various poses. One of the things I really appreciate about this mat is its commitment to eco-friendliness and health: it's free of harmful chemicals and phthalates, making it a safer choice for both me and the environment. 

However, the initial chemical smell upon unboxing the mat did concern me at first. To address this, I followed Gaiam's suggestion and let the mat air out for 2-3 days before using it. Thankfully, the odor dissipated completely, and I was able to start practicing on it without any issues. 

In terms of usability, this mat has exceeded my expectations. The non-slip surface ensures a secure grip during challenging poses, while the comfortable thickness allows me to practice on hard floors without experiencing discomfort. Additionally, I found the mat easy to clean and maintain, which is a bonus for those who may not have the time or patience for extensive upkeep. 

However, one caveat worth mentioning is the durability of the printed design. I've noticed that some areas of the mat have begun to show signs of wear after only a few weeks of regular use. This might be an issue for those seeking a long-lasting yoga mat. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Gaiam Premium Print Yoga Mat in Indigo Point to anyone looking to enhance their home practice. Its beautiful design, comfortable thickness, and commitment to eco-friendliness make it a worthwhile investment for both beginners and experienced yogis alike. 


### [Celestial Blue Yoga Mat with Lifetime Guarantee](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-print-yoga-mat-celestial-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-print-yoga-mat-celestial-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh, this Celestial Blue Yoga Mat, what a treasure! The first time I unrolled it, I totally felt like I was doing yoga under a starlit night sky. It's made of a soft, latex-free PVC, but don't be fooled by its gentle touch; it has a "sticky" surface that keeps you firmly grounded on your poses. I especially dig that it's got a 6mm cushioning layer - just perfect for some home or studio sessions! Plus, it comes with a lifetime guarantee. 

One thing I noticed is that the mat has a rather potent smell when new. I'd suggest laying it out for a couple days to air out before giving it a go. Oh, and when cleaning it, just use a damp cloth or our Yoga Mat Wash. Just make sure you don't keep it out under the sun for too long, or it might fade or become brittle. 

Now, about the cons, there isn't much to complain. Some users found the mat a bit too soft and squishy. However, it totally depends on personal comfort. As for the smell, I mentioned that it dissipates after airing it out. So, nothing too worrisome there. 

The verdict? The Celestial Blue Yoga Mat by Gaiam is a beautiful and well-made mat. It's comfortable, sturdy, and comes with a lifetime guarantee. Plus, I'm absolutely in love with the starry design. It's like doing yoga with a bit of cosmic magic. ‚ú®

### [Gaiam Metallic Sunset Yoga Mat 6mm](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-metallic-sunset-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-metallic-sunset-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a daily yoga enthusiast, I recently had the pleasure of using the Gaiam Premium Metallic Sunset Yoga Mat. The first thing I noticed about this mat was its striking and eye-catching design. Its colorful, metallic pattern instantly added a touch of class and style to my workout space. 

The dimensions of the mat are perfect for my needs - 5.67 ft long and 2 ft wide. The 6mm thick padding provides a comfortable cushioning that helped ease any pressure on my joints during intense yoga sessions, while also maintaining a good level of stability. 

One feature that particularly stood out to me was the textured non-slip surface. I found that this made it easier for me to maintain proper alignment and positioning in various poses without worrying about slipping or losing my balance. 

However, there were some cons as well. Some users have reported that this mat has a strong chemical smell initially, which may dissipate over time but can be quite unpleasant. Additionally, I noticed that the thickness might not suit everyone, as some users found it too soft and lacking in support. 

Overall, I would recommend the Gaiam Premium Metallic Sunset Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable addition to their yoga practice. Its appealing design, comfortable padding, and solid grip make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced yogis alike. 


### [Gaiam Yoga Mat - Pink Marrakesh](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-4mm-yoga-mat-pink-marrakesh-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-4mm-yoga-mat-pink-marrakesh-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started doing yoga in the comfort of my home, so I purchased the Gaiam 4mm Yoga Mat in Pink Marrakesh. The mat's design instantly caught my eye, and I was excited to try it out. The surface is textured, providing great grip even during my most intense sessions. One of my favorite features is the light-tack non-slip texture that keeps my hands and feet stable throughout each pose. 

Dimensions-wise, the mat is 172 x 61 cm, which is just right for my home space. At 4mm thickness, it's quite comfortable to use and helps with proper alignment during practice. The material, PVC, feels durable and robust, giving me confidence that this mat will withstand regular use. 

However, one minor inconvenience I experienced was a plastic-like odor upon unboxing the mat. After following the manufacturer's instructions to wipe it down and air out for a few days, the odor dissipated, but it was noticeable initially. Another drawback from a user's perspective is the slippery surface, which can be challenging for maintaining poses. I hope that the texture will improve over time. 

Overall, I would still recommend the Gaiam 4mm Yoga Mat in Pink Marrakesh to others. This mat's attractive design, comfort, and stability features make it a great option for fellow yogis. Just be aware of the odor upon unboxing and the initial slipperiness, which might affect your practice experience. 


### [Reversible Floral Mantra Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gaiam-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-reversible-yoga-mat-kaleidoscope-sea-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-reversible-yoga-mat-kaleidoscope-sea-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Gaiam Reversible Yoga Mat in Kaleidoscope Sea, and I must say, it has been a game-changer. The moment I laid eyes on that vibrant, two-sided design, I knew I had to have it. The best part? I can flip it over to match my mood! Whether I'm feeling zen with the kaleidoscopic pattern or inspired with the bold sea life print, this mat has kept me excited for my yoga practice. 

One thing that really stood out to me is its thickness. At 6mm, it provides an extra level of comfort, especially when those downward dog poses start to get intense. Not to mention, the textured surface offers great grip, making sure I don't slip and slide during those sweaty sessions. 

Now, I'll be honest. When I first unboxed the mat, it did have a noticeable smell. However, I aired it out for a few days, and it dissipated completely. Once it was odor-free, I couldn't be happier with its quality and performance. 

The only downside, in my opinion, is that the grip could be slightly better. Some users have mentioned that their hands started to slip when they got sweaty. In my experience, though, it hasn't been too much of an issue, especially once I got into the groove of my practice. 

Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the Gaiam Reversible Yoga Mat in Kaleidoscope Sea. Its stunning design, comfortable thickness, and reliable grip make it an essential addition to my daily yoga routine. I would highly recommend this mat to anyone looking to elevate their practice and add a touch of color and creativity to their yoga space.
