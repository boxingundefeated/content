### [Bigfoot 100lb Kettlebell by Onnit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Meet the Bigfoot kettlebell, the newest addition to my workout routine. This 90-pound beast has become a staple in my home gym, and it's not for the faint-hearted. The first thing I noticed about it was its undeniable appeal. The design is simply striking, featuring a hairy, savage Sasquatch on the front that never fails to inspire me. 

In terms of performance, this kettlebell truly delivers. Its impressive 90-pound weight has pushed me to my limits, helping me build strength and endurance faster than ever before. Plus, the solid construction and sturdy build ensure that it can withstand even the most intense workout sessions. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the handle width is a little too narrow for comfort during certain exercises, which can make the grip uncomfortable after a while. Secondly, the intricate design on the handle can sometimes feel sharp against my hands, especially when they're covered in sweat. 

All in all, the Bigfoot kettlebell is a standout addition to my workout gear. It's well-made, striking in appearance, and it consistently challenges me to push myself harder. While there are some minor inconveniences that come with its unique design, they're definitely outweighed by its many benefits. If you're looking for a new, exciting way to get in shape, this kettlebell is definitely worth considering. 


### [BalanceFrom Wide Grip Kettlebell Set, 3-Piece: 5, 10, 15 Lbs.](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-wide-grip-kettlebell-exercise-fitness-weight-set-3-pieces-5lb-10lb-and-15lb-kettlebells--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I first encountered Balancefrom's Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set while browsing for workout gear that would cater to my varied fitness needs. As a fitness enthusiast, I'm always in search of versatile, functional, and above all, safe workout equipment. I was drawn to this set mainly because of its wide grips and the range of weights it offered, but little did I know that it would exceed my expectations in more ways than one. 

Upon unpacking, I was immediately impressed by the solid feel of each kettlebell. Unlike some of the other kettlebells on the market that are made of a hollow plastic shell, these are vinyl-coated and filled with iron sand, which provides a sturdy, reliable weight. The wide grip handles are both comfortable and easy to use, giving me the confidence to perform a diverse range of exercises without worrying about slipping or losing control. 

One highlight of this kettlebell set is the progressive resistance it offers. The 5lb, 10lb, and 15lb kettlebells are all seamlessly incorporated into the set, allowing me to gradually increase the weight as I continue to grow stronger and more proficient with kettlebell exercises. This has been particularly useful in my personal fitness journey, as it encourages me to continually challenge myself and push my limits. 

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows with this product. While the vinyl coating on these kettlebells provides a good grip, I've found that it tends to wear off over time, especially around the handle area. Additionally, the stickers that indicate the weight of each kettlebell are prone to peeling off, which can be a bit inconvenient if you're using these in a shared space where multiple weights might be present. 

The packaging of this product is another area where some improvements could be made. While the kettlebells themselves are well-constructed and secure, the box they come in is quite large and cumbersome, making it difficult to store and transport. It's also worth mentioning that some of the weights may be slightly inaccurate, although I haven't encountered any major discrepancies in my personal use of this set. 

In conclusion, Balancefrom's Wide Grip Kettlebell Exercise Fitness Weight Set has been a valuable addition to my home gym. The combination of sturdy construction, wide grip handles, and progressive resistance has allowed me to consistently challenge myself and improve my overall fitness. While there are some minor drawbacks to this product, such as the wear-prone vinyl coating and peeling weight stickers, these issues haven't significantly detracted from the overall quality and functionality of the set. Overall, I would recommend this kettlebell set to anyone seeking a versatile, effective, and affordable workout solution. 


### [Body-Solid Powder Coated Iron Kettlebell, 100lb](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="body-solid-kbr-powder-coated-iron-kettlebells-100lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-kbr-powder-coated-iron-kettlebells-100lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who's been using the KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells by Body-Solid, I can honestly say they've breathed new life into my workout routine. The matte-black chip-resistant powder-coat finish adds a sleek touch and provides an excellent grip, even during the most intense sweating sessions. I also absolutely love the easy-to-read weight display, which ensures that I always have the right size and weight at my disposal. The flat machined bottoms offer a stable, wobble-free workout environment, making me feel safer with every use. With a range of weights available, from 5 to 100 lbs, these kettlebells are perfect for fitness beginners and experts alike. Additionally, their durability ensures that they not only look great but remain in pristine condition for a long, long time. 

However, one downside I would mention is that the heavier kettlebells can be a bit challenging to handle, particularly with smaller hands. Despite this, the KBR Powder Coated Iron Kettlebells by Body-Solid have undoubtedly made a positive impact on my fitness journey. 


### [40lb. YORK Barbell Hercules Kettlebell for Strengthening Muscles](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="york-barbell-15140-40-lb-kettlebell-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/york-barbell-15140-40-lb-kettlebell-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently invested in the York Barbell 40 lb. Kettlebell to diversify my home workout routine, and I couldn't be happier with my choice! This solid cast iron kettlebell perfectly complements my existing gym equipment, providing a versatile and effective tool for strength training. 

From the moment I received my kettlebell, I was impressed by its durability and well-thought-out design. The uniquely positioned handle provides a comfortable and smooth grip, making swings and other exercises incredibly easy and enjoyable. Plus, the weight of this kettlebell is well-balanced, allowing me to maintain proper form throughout each workout. 

While the kettlebell's paint job may not be perfect, the quality of the product far outweighs any minor cosmetic flaws. This kettlebell has quickly become a staple in my home gym, and I'm confident that it will continue to withstand regular use for years to come. 

In summary, the York Barbell 40 lb. Kettlebell offers exceptional quality and versatility at an affordable price. Its unique design comfortably accommodates various exercises, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and seasoned fitness enthusiasts.

### [Premium 65lb Rubber Kettlebell for Full Body Fitness](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="corefx-rubber-kettlebell-65-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/corefx-rubber-kettlebell-65-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been a fitness enthusiast for quite some time now, and when I came across the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell, I knew I had to give it a try. I must say, it's been a game-changer in my home gym. Not only does it bring some variety to my workout routine but also helps me achieve new levels of strength and flexibility. 

The Corefx Kettlebell is more than just your average piece of workout equipment. Its rubber coating provides excellent grip and protection against scuffs and chips that could otherwise occur with regular use. Plus, the variety in sizes caters to different fitness levels, making it suitable for everyone. 

One feature that stood out for me was its versatility. Whether you're swinging, squatting, or performing any other kettlebell workout, this little powerhouse delivers a full-body workout that's hard to beat. It's no wonder fitness studios and gyms have it as a staple in their facilities. 

However, there are some minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the handle lacks a textured grip, which can be slightly uncomfortable without gloves. Secondly, the initial greasy coating on the rubber might come as an unpleasant surprise, but a quick wash solves this issue easily. 

All in all, the Corefx Rubber Kettlebell is a solid addition to any home gym or fitness studio. While it may have a few minor flaws, the benefits it offers far outweigh them. So if you're looking for a versatile tool to enhance your fitness journey, this kettlebell is definitely worth considering! 


### [75 Lb Power Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-75-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-cast-powder-coated-kettlebells-5-100-lbs-kbr-75-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently took the plunge and added a 75-pound Body Solid kettlebell to my home gym, and boy am I glad I did! This sleek, cast iron piece of equipment has quickly become a staple in my workout routine. The enamel finish not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also provides a durable surface that can withstand my intense kettlebell workouts. 

One of the features that truly impresses me is the handle size on the heavier kettlebells, which means both hands can comfortably fit and provide extra stability for more challenging lifts. What truly sets this product apart from others is its versatility â€“ the wide range of exercises that can be performed using a kettlebell makes it an effective tool for developing strength, power, endurance, and balance. 

However, there is one downside to note â€“ as this kettlebell is quite heavy, it can be challenging for newcomers to the world of kettlebells. But for those willing to put in the effort and take their fitness to the next level, Body Solid's KBR75 is definitely worth considering. So go ahead and make your workouts more exciting and effective with this amazing kettlebell! 


### [36kg Powder Coated Cast Iron Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="cast-iron-powder-coated-kettlebell-36kg-80lb-size-36-kg-79-lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/cast-iron-powder-coated-kettlebell-36kg-80lb-size-36-kg-79-lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on this 36kg powder coated kettlebell and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my home gym. The powder coating provides a textured grip that keeps my hands comfortably in place even during those sweaty workout sessions. The smooth finish is an added bonus, removing any friction or discomfort during intense kettlebell swings. Also, the color indicators make identifying different weights a breeze. 

What sets this kettlebell apart from others is its single cast construction. Unlike some brands that weld their handles onto the body, this kettlebell is made from a single cast, ensuring maximum durability and peace of mind. And did I mention it also has both KG and LB weight indications debossed on it? A great feature for anyone who's not too familiar with the metric system. 

However, one thing to note is that this kettlebell is quite heavy at 36kg (80lb), which might be a bit overwhelming for beginners. But if you're looking to up your kettlebell game, this one definitely delivers in terms of quality and performance. So if you're ready to take your strength and endurance workouts to the next level, this powder coated kettlebell might just be what you need. 


### [Stamina Adjustable Versa-Bell: 16-36 lb Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="stamina-36-lb-adjustable-kettle-versa-bell-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stamina-36-lb-adjustable-kettle-versa-bell-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Stamina's Adjustable Kettle Versa-Bell is a real game-changer for fitness enthusiasts. I've been using this kettlebell for a few weeks now and let me tell you, I've been seeing results! This single piece of equipment has the power to replace your whole kettlebell set, offering six weight levels ranging from 16 to 36 pounds. The most appealing feature is its adjustability. You simply twist to add or remove weights in 4-pound increments, making it perfect for varying exercises and workout intensity. 

Another great thing about this kettlebell is its handle. The cast iron grip feels solid and comfortable, allowing me to switch between one-handed and two-handed holds with ease. As for design, the rounded base adds another layer of functionality. It's sturdy enough to support pushups or other stability exercises. 

However, it's not all roses with this product. While the handle is comfortable, I found it a bit too large for my smaller hands during certain exercises. Also, the weights can make a bit of noise when swinging or transitioning to different exercises. Lastly, I wish the starting weight could be a little lighter at 12 pounds instead of 16. 

Despite these minor cons, overall, this product is definitely worth your investment. Its adjustable weights, solid construction, and user-friendly design make it a great addition to any home gym. Plus, with free access to the mv smart audio coaching app, you'll have all the guidance you need to get started on your fitness journey. Happy lifting! 


### [Blogilates Iron Kettlebell 15lbs - Coral Pink](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="blogilates-iron-kettlebell-coral-pink-15lbs-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blogilates-iron-kettlebell-coral-pink-15lbs-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Blogilates Iron Kettlebell in Coral Pink, 15lbs. Over the past few weeks, I've been incorporating this colorful kettlebell into my workout routine and have to say that it's added a new level of enthusiasm and excitement to my exercise sessions. 

The color - Coral Pink - is truly unique and definitely sets it apart from other kettlebells I've used before. It's not as vibrant as shown in the images online, but it has a distinct mauve touch that makes it stand out. However, the weight is spot-on, providing the right amount of resistance for various exercises. 

One of the things I noticed immediately was the smooth and comfortable grip of the handle. Unlike some other kettlebells I've used, this one doesn't have any sharp edges or rough spots, making it a joy to use. Even during intense workout sessions, the gold-colored handle remains securely in my hands without causing any strain or discomfort. 

Although the kettlebell itself is quite sturdy, I was a bit disappointed with the packaging it arrived in. It wasn't as clean and pristine as I expected it to be, which made me worry about its cleanliness. However, a good wipe-down with some disinfectant resolved this issue. 

In my experience, the Blogilates Iron Kettlebell in Coral Pink, 15lbs, delivers on both form and function. Its unique design adds an aesthetic appeal to my home workout space, while its comfortable grip and sturdy construction make it a reliable workout companion. However, the cleanliness upon arrival could be improved to provide a better first impression. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a stylish and effective kettlebell for your workout routine, this one is definitely worth considering. 


### [Body-Solid 45lb Premium Kettlebell](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="body-solid-45lb-premium-kettlebell-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/body-solid-45lb-premium-kettlebell-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently incorporated the 45lb Body Solid kettlebell into my workout routine, and it's been a game-changer. Unlike traditional dumbbells, the kettlebell's unique shape allows for a wider range of exercises that target different muscle groups in a single movement. The weight reference is really easy to read, making it easy to choose the right kettlebell for my workout needs. 

The chrome handles on this kettlebell are amazing - they're smooth and comfortable in my hands, providing a great grip even during intense workouts. And for those who prefer two-handed movements, the handles on the heavier kettlebells are large enough to accommodate both hands comfortably. 

However, there's one thing that could be improved - the size of the kettlebell. At 21"L x 16"W x 19"H, it's not exactly the most portable option out there, which can be a bit inconvenient if you're looking to take your workout on-the-go. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Body Solid kettlebell for anyone looking to add some variety to their workout routine and improve their strength and endurance. It's a versatile piece of equipment that can help take your workouts to the next level. 


### [GORUCK 18lb Sand Kettlebell - Durable, Customizable Weight](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gorilla-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/goruck-sand-kettlebell-18lb-8kg-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid fitness enthusiast, I decided to give the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell a try. The first thing I noticed was its impressive durability and well-constructed design, making it stand out from typical kettlebells. The neoprene-padded handle provides comfort during use, and the reinforced stitching at every seam shows no signs of wear despite my regular workouts. 

One of the main selling points of this product is its adjustable weight feature. I was able to switch from a 12lb kettlebell workout to a more challenging 18lb workout effortlessly by adding more sand. This versatility made it perfect for incorporating varied intensity levels into my routine. 

However, filling the kettlebell with sand can be challenging at times. The initial weight may not be enough, requiring additional sand to reach the desired level. This process can also lead to some sand leakage, but the sturdy velcro enclosure ensures minimal loss. 

In terms of performance, the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell offers a unique workout experience compared to traditional solid kettlebells. The shifting weight of sand creates a more dynamic workout, engaging additional muscles during each exercise. The flexible handle might take some time to get used to, especially for exercises like goblet squats, but it still delivers a satisfying workout. 

Overall, I'm highly impressed with the GORUCK Sand Kettlebell. Its innovative design, durability, and adjustable weight make it a valuable asset for anyone looking to diversify their fitness routine. Despite some minor drawbacks, this product has earned a spot in my home gym.
