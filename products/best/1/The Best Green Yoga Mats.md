### [Premium 5mm Classic Yoga Mat by Gaiam](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat (5mm) Cool Mint - 05-63618. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my practice. The mat is lightweight and portable, making it easy to take along with me to classes or just roll out in my living room for a home practice. 

One of the standout features of this yoga mat is its sticky textured surface. As someone who tends to sweat a lot during yoga, I've struggled with slippery mats in the past. But with the Gaiam mat, I can confidently hold poses without worrying about losing my grip. Even when I'm transitioning between poses, the mat stays put and doesn't shift underneath me. 

Another thing I really appreciated about this mat is its thickness. At 5mm, it provides ample cushioning for my joints while still being stable and supportive. It's comfortable to practice on, and I feel much more secure in my alignment during poses like chaturanga or downward dog. 

However, there are a couple of cons to this mat as well. Firstly, it does have a noticeable odor when first unrolled, which is a common issue with PVC mats. Fortunately, as the other reviewers suggested, airing it out and wiping it down with a damp cloth before use helped reduce the smell significantly. 

Secondly, while the mat is technically latex-free and 6P-free PVC, some users may still be sensitive to the materials used. If you have allergies or sensitivities to certain chemicals, it might be worth doing some additional research before purchasing this mat. 

Overall, I've been very happy with the Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat. Its sticky surface, comfortable thickness, and lightweight design make it a great choice for both beginner and experienced yogis alike. Just be prepared for a slight odor at first and consider your own sensitivity to certain materials before making your decision. 


### [All-Purpose Extra Thick Yoga Mat & Knee Pad with Carrying Strap (Green)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-1-2-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-and-kne-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-goyoga-all-purpose-1-2-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-and-kne-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Balancefrom GoYoga+ All-Purpose 1/2-Inch Extra Thick High Density Anti-Tear Exercise Yoga Mat and Knee Pad with Carrying Strap (Green) for my daily yoga sessions, and I must say, it's been quite a game-changer in my practice. This yoga mat comes with a separate knee pad, which has proven to be a lifesaver for those of us with weaker knees, offering extra cushioning during more challenging poses. 

One of the standout features of this yoga mat is its exceptional non-slip traction, which ensures that I can perform even the most demanding poses with complete confidence, knowing that I won't lose my balance and risk injury. I've also been pleasantly surprised by how well it cushions my spine, hips, knees, and elbows on hard floors, making my practice more comfortable overall. 

The moisture-resistant technology of the mat is also worth mentioning, as it makes cleaning up after a sweaty session a breeze, allowing me to quickly wash the mat with soap and water and have it ready for my next practice. Plus, the easy-to-handle strapping makes the process of transporting and storing the mat super convenient. 

However, it's not all perfectly smooth sailing with the GoYoga+ mat. Some users have reported a lingering odor even after repeated uses, which can be quite off-putting. Additionally, a few users have mentioned that the material can be prone to damage, which is something to keep in mind if you're particularly rough on your gear. 

Overall, the Balancefrom GoYoga+ All-Purpose 1/2-Inch Extra Thick High Density Anti-Tear Exercise Yoga Mat and Knee Pad with Carrying Strap (Green) is an excellent addition to any yoga practitioner's arsenal, offering a comfortable, non-slip surface and a thoughtful inclusion of a separate knee pad. While there have been some issues with odor and material durability, these minor inconveniences are overshadowed by the mat's superior performance and overall value for money. 


### [Eco-Friendly Green Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I have to be honest - I didn't think much of the Wai Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat at first glance. But after using it for a few days, boy, was I proven wrong! The first highlight of this mat is its thickness. Double the regular, this mat has enough cushioning to give comfort and safety for even the most intense yoga and Pilates sessions. 

Secondly, the grip on this baby is top-notch! I was able to hold poses without worrying about slipping, which is definitely a plus when you're just starting out. And speaking of newbies, the extra cushion on this mat provides support and stability during difficult poses. I've never felt so confident during certain exercises! 

However, one downside is that it's quite bulky, making it a bit tricky to carry around. But overall, the Wai Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat has definitely made my yoga and Pilates sessions more enjoyable and safer. 

The added green color adds an aesthetically pleasing touch, making it a perfect fusion of style and functionality. So, if you're in the market for a yoga or Pilates mat, or even just upgrading from your current one, look no further than the Wai Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat. You won't regret it! 


### [Extra Thick Yoga Mat with Carrying Strap (Green)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-gocloud-all-purpose-1-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-car-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-gocloud-all-purpose-1-inch-extra-thick-high-density-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-car-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently took up yoga and let me tell you, this BalanceFrom GoCloud Exercise Yoga Mat has been a game-changer. From my first downward dog, I was smitten! It's incredibly comfortable and supportive, thanks to its extra-thick high-density foam that absorbs impact and reduces pressure on my joints. The anti-tear surface gives me peace of mind, knowing it'll last through my intense workout sessions. 

The double-sided non-slip feature is my personal favorite. No more sliding across the room when I'm in the middle of a sun salutation! It's really easy to clean too, just soap and water will do the trick. 

I also love the included carrying strap. It makes transporting and storing my mat a breeze. And yes, it's lightweight and portable, perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle. Plus, it looks great. The green color is soothing and calming, just what I need for my yoga practice. 

However, there's one downside I have to mention. The scent. It has a distinct chemical smell when I first unpack it. But don't worry, it does seem to dissipate over time. 

Overall, I'm thrilled with this mat. It's comfortable, stylish, and portable. Whether you're a seasoned yogi or just starting out, this mat is definitely worth considering. 


### [Natural Sol Living Yoga Mat - Green](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="sol-living-premium-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sol-living-premium-natural-rubber-yoga-mat-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a dedicated yogi, I was excited to incorporate the Sol Living Natural Rubber Yoga Mat into my practice. Right from the start, it struck me as a high-quality mat with a smooth, comfortable surface that provided ample grip to support even the toughest of poses. I appreciated the fact that it's 100% natural rubber, free of any harmful chemicals, and longer and wider than standard mats, making it suitable for people of all statures and yoga styles. 

One of the most noticeable features of this mat was its superior grip. Even during the most intense sessions, I never found myself slipping or losing my footing. The textured surface also added a nice touch of cushioning, making my practice more comfortable and enjoyable. 

On the downside, I found the mat to be a bit on the heavier side, which made it slightly less portable for on-the-go practice. Additionally, some users reported a mild odor that lingered for a few days after unpacking. 

In conclusion, the Sol Living Natural Rubber Yoga Mat has definitely enhanced my yoga experience. Its durability, grip, and natural materials make it a top choice for any yogi looking for a reliable and comfortable mat for their practice. 


### [Green Cork Yoga Mat for Stability and Support](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="all-in-motion-natural-cork-tpe-5mm-green-yoga-mat-target-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/all-in-motion-natural-cork-tpe-5mm-green-yoga-mat-target-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast, I've tried numerous yoga mats, but the All in Motion Natural Cork TPE 5mm Yoga Mat truly stands out. The natural cork material provides excellent grip and is highly durable. Its non-slip texture ensures stability and support during even the most intense yoga sessions. What I particularly appreciate is the cork's ability to absorb sweat, which prevents any slippage. 

Despite its excellent traction, the mat is lightweight and easy to transport. It rolls up neatly for storage and doesn't take up much space in my workout bag. However, the rigid cork surface may make it difficult to roll up as compactly as foam mats. 

One minor issue I've encountered is that the cork surface may need some breaking in to achieve optimal flatness. But once it does, the comfort and support it provides are unmatched. 

All in all, the All in Motion Natural Cork TPE 5mm Yoga Mat has been a game-changer in my yoga practice. Its natural, eco-friendly material and top-notch performance make it a must-have for yogis at any level. 


### [Green Eco-Friendly Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-celestial-green-yoga-mat-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-celestial-green-yoga-mat-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Gaiam Celestial Green Yoga Mat has been a game-changer in my daily yoga practice. From the moment I started using it, I knew this wasn't your regular yoga mat. It's made from 5mm cushioned foam that provides just the right amount of support for my knees and joints. As someone who spends hours stretching and flexing on this mat, I can vouch for its durability and comfort. 

One feature that I absolutely love about this mat is its stabilizing non-slip surface. It doesn't matter how much I'm sweating during an intense yoga session, my mat stays put. Plus, the light nub feel offers slip resistance, good grip, and even a light massage effect on my palms and soles. Even when I'm transitioning between poses, I never have to worry about losing balance due to movement under my feet or hands. 

However, there's one downside - the mat tends to be a bit slippery initially. But this isn't too much of a problem as it improved significantly after a few uses. I also wish the mat came with a simple sleeve bag for portability, but that's just a minor inconvenience. 

In conclusion, the Gaiam Celestial Green Yoga Mat has been a reliable companion in my fitness journey. Its 5mm cushioning, non-slip surface, and overall durability make it worth the investment. Despite some initial slips, I'm thoroughly satisfied with its performance and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium yoga mat.

Additionally, its thickness provides just enough cushioning for comfort and support, even during more demanding poses. 

However, there are a few downsides to consider. Some users may find its size or weight a bit cumbersome if they need to carry it around frequently. Additionally, while the rubber used in the mat is eco-friendly, it does have a distinct smell that may take some getting used to.

## Buyer's Guide


### 1. Materials

The material of a green yoga mat is one of the primary considerations. Many people prefer eco-friendly materials such as natural rubber, jute, and organic cotton due to their sustainability. Other options include recycled PVC and TPE (Thermoplastic Elastomer), which are more eco-friendly than traditional PVC. 


### 2. Thickness and Durability

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Green+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Green Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

Yoga mats come in various thicknesses, ranging from 1/16 inch to 1/4 inch. Thicker mats provide more cushioning and comfort during practice, but they may be less stable and harder to carry around. Durability is also important, as it ensures your mat will last a long time. Look for a mat with a sturdy construction that can withstand regular use and washing. 


### 3. Traction and Slip-Resistance

A good yoga mat should offer slip-resistance, especially one made of green materials. Look for mats with textured surfaces or those coated with grippy materials that provide firm traction during practice. This helps enhance safety and prevent injuries, particularly during high-heat yoga forms like Bikram or Ashtanga. 


### 4. Size

Yoga mats come in different sizes, ranging from standard (68 inches long and 24 inches wide) to extra-long and extra-wide versions. Consider your height and whether you might need extra space for certain poses or for taller postures. Also, keep in mind that wider mats can be more challenging to transport and store. 


### 5. Portability

If you plan to travel or practice outside, consider a yoga mat that is lightweight and easy to carry. Mats with carrying straps or those that can be folded or rolled up compactly are good options. But remember, lightweight mats may not be as comfortable or durable as heavier ones. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/green-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Green+Yoga+Mats-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Green Yoga Mats-3"></a></div>


### 6. Price

Green yoga mats come in a wide range of prices. While higher-priced mats generally offer better quality and longer-lasting performance, there are also affordable eco-friendly options available. Determine your budget and research the various materials, durability, and additional features each mat offers before making a decision. 


### 7. Initial Smell and Odor

Some natural rubber or jute yoga mats may have a strong odor early on, which could cause discomfort or distraction during practice. Consider whether this odor is likely to dissipate over time or if it's something you can tolerate. You may also want to air out or clean your mat before using it for the first time. 


### 8. Personal Preference

Lastly, consider your personal preferences. Some people prefer softer mats for certain yoga styles, while others need extra grip for hot yoga. It's worth trying out various mats to find the one that feels best under your body and matches your unique needs and style of practice.
