### [Jade Voyager Yoga Mat: Ultralight and Eco-Friendly](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-voyager-yoga-mat-olive-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-voyager-yoga-mat-olive-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Jade Voyager yoga mat after hearing so many good things about it. And I have to say, I was not disappointed. This little mat is a game-changer for anyone who loves practicing yoga on the go. 

First off, the size and weight are perfect. It folds up compactly like a small towel, which means it easily fits in my suitcase or carry-on bag. Plus, at just 0.7 kg, I hardly notice it's there. This makes it ideal for travelling, whether I'm going away for a weekend or hopping on a long-haul flight. 

But don't let its petite size fool you. This mat packs a punch when it comes to grip. Even during sweaty sessions, I never had to worry about sliding all over the place. The natural rubber also provides enough cushioning to keep me comfortable during practice. 

However, I did encounter some cons. One issue is that this mat tends to crease when folded for an extended period. While not a deal-breaker, these creases do take some time to flatten out after unfolding. Another downside is that it doesn't come with a strap or carrier, making it a bit of a hassle to carry around without a bag or strap. 

Despite these minor setbacks, I would still wholeheartedly recommend the Jade Voyager yoga mat. Its portability, grip, and comfort make it a solid choice for yogis who are constantly on the move. Just be prepared to buy a separate strap to carry it in!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who got into yoga during the pandemic, I've tried quite a few mats. But none have impressed me as much as the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat. Its natural rubber material is not only eco-friendly but also provides an excellent grip, even when things start to get sweaty. The thickness of the mat offers just the right balance between cushioning and firmness, making it comfortable on my knees without compromising stability. I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - a quick wipe with a damp cloth and it's good to go! While some users have mentioned a strong rubber smell initially, I found it to be relatively mild. All in all, I can confidently say that the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat is worth its price tag. 

However, one aspect that could be improved is the portability. The mat is on the heavier side, which might not be an issue for most people, but if you're frequently carrying it around, this could pose a problem. Additionally, the natural rubber material can attract dust and fur, which might be inconvenient for those with pets. Despite these minor issues, I believe that the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat is a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, reliable yoga mat.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Get ready to start your yoga journey with the Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat. This high-quality mat is made for those who want a comfortable, supportive, and stylish experience. The PVC material is super durable and the non-slip surface provides an excellent grip during your practice. 

The mat is reversible and features two beautiful designs, so you can switch up your look anytime. At 6mm thick, it offers ample cushioning to protect your knees and joints. I personally love the sun and moon pattern on one side, which helps me stay centered and in balance. 

As for the smell, some users have noted that the mat has a peculiar scent when first opened. I've been using this mat for a few weeks now and found that airing it out in a well-ventilated area for a day or so helps to dissipate any unwanted odors. Plus, I've discovered that using the mat has made yoga even more enjoyable for me, with its increased comfort and support. 

The only downside I've noticed is that the grip quality isn't top-notch for those who sweat a lot. However, once broken in, the mat becomes much less slippery, making it easier to hold poses and maintain stability during practice. 

In conclusion, the Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat is a worthy investment for yoga enthusiasts. With its versatile design, excellent cushioning, and adjustable grip, this mat is sure to enhance your practice and promote relaxation and mindfulness.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a loyal yoga practitioner, I always sought for a yoga rug that not only felt natural but also offered the perfect grip. When I came across the Jade Yoga Rug Black, it was love at first use! This traditional rug, made of organic cotton, harks back to the original yoga practice. Its length and width are perfect for all yoga styles, even for outdoor sessions on the beach. 

What I particularly love about the Jade Yoga Rug is its hand-woven craftsmanship from India. This rug is not only a testament to the beautiful work of local craftsmen and women, but also a way to support these rural communities. Plus, by purchasing this rug, you're helping Jade provide a hot lunch to needy children in India for a week. 

Speaking of the rug's quality, it's incredibly durable, thanks to its natural plant dyes from herbs and spices like indigo, cumin, and turmeric. While it may feel a bit stiff initially, it softens with use and becomes incredibly comfortable. The grip is exceptional, especially when you're drenched in sweat. 

One aspect that could be improved is the rug's propensity to move slightly when used on a smoother surface. You might need to put something underneath it to keep it firmly in place. 

Overall, the Jade Yoga Rug Black is a fantastic addition to my yoga practice. Its natural materials, exceptional craftsmanship, and eco-friendly packaging make it a truly special product. I look forward to exploring more colors and sharing the magic of this rug with others.

In my daily practice of yoga, I've been using the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional (3 16") yoga mat. This mat has been a game-changer for me, especially when attempting new, challenging poses. With its thick design, I can maintain stability during standing poses and trust that I won't slip during intense sessions. 

The Open cell feature on this yoga mat is a standout, providing excellent traction and ensuring a secure grip throughout my practice. Made from natural rubber, this mat is not only durable but also eco-friendly, containing no PVC or ozone depleting substances. 

One noteworthy aspect of this mat is its thickness. At 3/16", it strikes the perfect balance between providing adequate cushioning for comfort and maintaining a firm surface for advanced poses. Additionally, its dimensions ensure that the mat accommodates practitioners of various heights. 

Caring for the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional mat is easy as well. Hand washing with warm water and mild soap is all it takes to keep this mat in pristine condition. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported that the mat tends to attract dust and dirt, which may require additional effort to keep clean. Additionally, the natural rubber scent can be quite strong initially. 

Overall, the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional mat has been a reliable and comfortable companion in my yoga journey. Its unique features, such as the Open cell technology and natural rubber construction, provide an excellent foundation for a successful practice.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-harmony-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-olive-green-374ol-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-olive-green-374ol-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional Yoga Mat, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my practice. As a tall yogi, the extra length of this mat provides ample space to stretch out and move freely. The thickness is just right - not too firm and not too squishy, making it comfortable to practice on but still offering enough support for balancing poses. 

The natural rubber material is another highlight, providing excellent grip even during sweaty sessions, which is essential for maintaining proper alignment throughout my practice. It's also great to know that Jade plants a tree for every mat sold, making this a conscious choice for environmentally-minded consumers. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to note. Firstly, the mat can be quite heavy due to its natural rubber construction, making portability slightly challenging. Additionally, some users might find the initial smell of the rubber off-putting, although this tends to dissipate over time. 

In summary, the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional Yoga Mat has made a positive impact on my daily yoga practice. Its extra length, natural rubber material, and exceptional grip make it an excellent choice for taller practitioners and those looking for an eco-friendly option. While it may not be the lightest or most odor-free mat on the market, its performance benefits outweigh these minor drawbacks.
