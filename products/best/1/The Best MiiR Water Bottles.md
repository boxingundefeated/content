### [Vacuum Insulated Gold Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-wide-mouth-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-harvest-gold-21" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-wide-mouth-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-harvest-gold-21/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The MiiR Wide Mouth bottle has truly been a game changer for me in my daily life. Its design is not only thoughtful but also aesthetically pleasing, with a sleek stainless steel construction that comes in a beautiful Harvest Gold color. The key feature that really stands out is its double wall vacuum insulation, which ensures that my beverages stay hot or cold for hours on end. 

One of my favorite parts about this bottle is its leakproof seal. After an incident where I accidentally knocked my old water bottle over, I've come to appreciating this feature even more. The twist-on lid doesn't allow any spills, so I don't have to worry about any messes in my bag. 

However, there's a minor downside to the bottle. The lid can be tricky to screw back on properly. It often takes me about eight attempts to get it right, which can be frustrating at times. 

Overall, I absolutely love this MiiR Wide Mouth bottle. It's durable, keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature, and saves me from buying disposable water bottles. Highly recommend! 


### [20-Ounce Black Wide-Mouth Insulated Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-20-oz-black-wide-mouth-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-20-oz-black-wide-mouth-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the MiiR 20-oz. Black Wide-Mouth Water Bottle, and it's been a game-changer in my daily water intake. First off, the size is perfect; the wide-mouth design ensures I can easily fill up with ice cubes and keep myself hydrated throughout the day. 

One of the standout features of this bottle is its thermal properties. Using the brand's Thermo 3D double-wall vacuum insulation, it can keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for hours on end. It's amazing how long it keeps my ice cubes from melting in the sweltering heat. 

However, there's one downside to this bottle - it's a little heavier than I expected. While the metal construction feels sturdy and durable, it can be cumbersome to carry around all day, especially if I'm filling it up with ice cubes. 

Another feature I really appreciate is the leakproof lid. The patented threaded design prevents spills and leaks, making this bottle ideal for tossing into a bag without worrying about any messes. 

Lastly, I have to mention how visually appealing this bottle is. The sleek black finish and minimalistic design make it a stylish addition to my collection. Plus, knowing that each purchase helps fund nonprofit organizations focused on community support and environmental protection adds a feel-good factor to the overall experience. 

In conclusion, the MiiR 20-oz. Black Wide-Mouth Water Bottle has exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality and style. While it may be a tad heavier than other bottles on the market, its thermal capabilities and leakproof design make it worth the investment. 


### [Cascara Kids Water Bottle by MiiR](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-kids-water-bottle-cascara-12-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-kids-water-bottle-cascara-12-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the first time I saw the MiiR Kids Water Bottle Cascara 12 oz. My toddler had been struggling with other water bottles, but this one was different. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design - it looked much more stylish than any other kids' bottle I've seen. And when I tried it out, I was blown away by its performance. 

The Thermo 3D double-wall vacuum insulation is a game-changer. My toddler can enjoy his drinks hot or cold for hours without any compromise on taste. Plus, there's no need to worry about sweaty hands or spillage, thanks to the leakproof design. 

One feature that really stands out is the easy 2-part assembly with a removable straw. It makes refilling and cleaning super simple, even for little hands. And let's not forget the protective on/off silicone boot with the debossed MiiR logo - a nice touch that adds durability and flair at the same time. 

There are some minor drawbacks though. The hardshell powder coat finish, while durable, can be a bit difficult to clean thoroughly, especially around the lid. But that's a small price to pay for a bottle that keeps my child hydrated and happy. 

In essence, the MiiR Kids Water Bottle Cascara 12 oz is more than just a kid's bottle. It's a stylish, high-performing accessory that provides peace of mind and convenience during those hectic days. If you're looking for a reliable companion for your child's hydration needs, look no further than this bottle. Its performance and durability are worth every penny. 


### [MiiR 23oz Insulated Bottle - Leak-Proof, Durable and Sweat-Free](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-insulated-narrow-mouth-bottle-prismatic-23-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-insulated-narrow-mouth-bottle-prismatic-23-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the 23oz MiiR Insulated Narrow Mouth Bottle in Prismatic for a few weeks now and I must say, it's become a trusty companion on my daily outings. The bottle's minimalist design and easy-carry leak-proof handle make it perfect for people who are always on the go. Plus, the thermal insulation is no joke - your beverages stay cold for 24+ hours or hot for up to 12, making it an ideal choice for both water and coffee lovers alike. 

One thing that really impresses me about this bottle is its double wall vacuum insulation technology. Not only does this keep your beverages at their optimal temperature, but it also prevents the bottle from sweating, leaving no unpleasant water rings on my car's dashboard or cupholder. 

However, there is one aspect that could use some improvement. The screw cap, while leak-proof and effective, is a bit cumbersome and can be a pain if you're trying to take a quick gulp while driving. An alternative top with a flip mechanism would be great! 

Overall, this MiiR bottle has become an integral part of my daily routine. Its high-quality build and excellent insulation capabilities make it a reliable choice for those looking for a stylish and functional bottle. I would definitely recommend it! 


### [Climate Positive MiiR Water Bottle for Cold and Hot Drinks](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="branded-water-bottles-miir-climate-wide-mouth-bottle-20-oz-sample-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/branded-water-bottles-miir-climate-wide-mouth-bottle-20-oz-sample-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My latest go-to accessory is the MiiR Climate Wide Mouth Water Bottle - 20 oz. I've been using it daily for the past month, and it's definitely enhanced my water drinking experience. The highlight for me is the sleek design and the stainless steel construction used in its manufacturing, which ensures durability and heat retention. 

The vacuum insulation is a game-changer that effectively keeps drinks cool or hot for extended periods. I remember filling the bottle one morning with ice-cold water, and even after several hours, the water was still refreshingly cold. The double-wall insulation has also been instrumental in preventing the bottle from "sweating" and leaving smudges behind. 

However, there is one drawback with this bottle. Tightening the lid can be a bit finicky, as it requires precision to prevent leakage. It took me a few tries to master it, but once I did, it was smooth sailing. 

In closing, the MiiR Climate Wide Mouth Water Bottle - 20 oz. is a reliable companion when it comes to staying hydrated and reducing the use of single-use plastic. It's not without its quirks, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives. 


### [Miir Black 27 oz Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/miir-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-bottle-black-27-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-bottle-black-27-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My journey with the Miir 27 oz water bottle has been nothing short of invigorating. This sleek and lightweight companion has been my trusty go-to for daily hydration needs and adventures alike. I've carried it on many hiking trails, and its minimalist design attracts plenty of envious glances from fellow hikers. 

One thing that's incredibly appealing about this bottle is its 27oz capacity. It's large enough to quench my thirst but not too cumbersome to hamper my mobility throughout the day. Plus, its leak-proof lid ensures I don't have to worry about any unexpected waterfalls in my bag. 

The 18/8 medical-grade stainless steel construction of this water bottle gives it a certain robustness. This ruggedness has proven beneficial when my clumsy hands have accidentally let it fall. Even after several such incidents, there hasn't been any noticeable dent or chip in the colourful powder coat finish. 

However, I must point out that the lid design could do with some improvements. Unfastening it requires a bit of maneuvering, and it isn't as user-friendly as it could be. A one-twist design, much like older models, would make things much easier and less strain-inducing for my wrists. 

In conclusion, the Miir 27 oz water bottle has been an exceptional addition to my daily life. Its durability, sleek design, and leak-proof feature make it a reliable companion on any outing. Despite the minor inconvenience with the lid, this water bottle stands out among others and earns a solid 4.5 stars from me.
