I have been using Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water for quite some time now and it has quickly become my go-to choice for bottled water. The source of this water comes from a natural spring in Iceland, which is known for its clean and unspoiled environment. The taste of this water is incredibly refreshing, with a subtle sweetness that sets it apart from other bottled waters.

This makes it an excellent choice for people who are looking to maintain a healthy acid-alkaline balance in their bodies. Additionally, the water is free of heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other impurities, making it a very pure option. 

Another great thing about Icelandic Glacial is its commitment to sustainability. The bottles and boxes are made from recycled materials, and the company has been certified as carbon neutral for both its products and operations. This makes it an excellent choice for environmentally-conscious consumers. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this water. Some users have reported inconsistencies in the taste and quality of the water, particularly when ordering online. Additionally, the water can be difficult to find in some areas, which makes it hard for some people to access regularly. 

Overall, I love using Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water as my primary source of hydration. Its refreshing taste, high alkalinity, and commitment to sustainability make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality bottled water option.
