The source of this water comes from a natural spring in Iceland, which is known for its clean and unspoiled environment. The taste of this water is incredibly refreshing, with a subtle sweetness that sets it apart from other bottled waters.

This makes it an excellent choice for environmentally-conscious consumers. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to this water. Some users have reported inconsistencies in the taste and quality of the water, particularly when ordering online. Additionally, the water can be difficult to find in some areas, which makes it hard for some people to access regularly. 

Overall, I love using Icelandic Glacial Natural Spring Water as my primary source of hydration. Its refreshing taste, high alkalinity, and commitment to sustainability make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality bottled water option.
