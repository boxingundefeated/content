### [96 Pack of Nestle Pure Life Purified Water Bottles](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="nestle-waters-north-america-101264-nestle-pure-life-purified-water-16-9-oz-96-bottles-in-total-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nestle-waters-north-america-101264-nestle-pure-life-purified-water-16-9-oz-96-bottles-in-total-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Nestle Pure Life's purified water for quite some time now, and I must say, it's been quite a refreshing experience. The multi-stage filtration process they use ensures that each bottle is packed full of clean, crisp, and delicious water. Plus, the added minerals make it extra nourishing for my body. I appreciate how Nestle Pure Life is conscious of the environment, using recycled materials and promoting responsible water usage. 

One thing I noticed, however, is that the taste of the water has changed over time. Some users have reported a metallic taste, which I can confirm is there. But despite this, I still find myself reaching for Nestle Pure Life more often than not, especially when I need a quick and easy hydration solution. 

In conclusion, Nestle Pure Life's purified water is a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable source of clean and refreshing water. The taste might be hit or miss, but the overall drinking experience is definitely worth it. Just remember to check the label and be aware of any potential changes in taste or quality. 


### [16.9 oz Purified Water Bottles by Pure Life](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="pure-life-purified-water-12-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pure-life-purified-water-12-pack-16-9-fl-oz-bottles-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Pure Life Purified Water's 16.9oz bottles for quite some time now, and I must say, they've become an indispensable part of my daily routine. Not only do I love the crisp, refreshing taste - which is a result of their 12-step quality process, but also that they're calorie and sugar-free, making them a healthier option than traditional sodas or juice. 

One aspect that stands out is their convenience size. The smaller bottles are perfect for quick sips on the go, whether it's in the car, at the office, or whilst running errands. Additionally, knowing that they have a blend of minerals added gives me peace of mind about the water's purity and taste, even if the source information may vary. 

On the other hand, as much as I appreciate the lightness of the bottles, I sometimes wish they were made of slightly thicker materials. Occasionally, I feel like the bottles can be a bit flimsy, especially when they're filled to the brim. 

All in all, Pure Life Purified Water's 16.9oz bottles have been an excellent addition to my household. From their refreshing taste to their convenient size, these bottles have made staying hydrated easier and more enjoyable than ever before. 


### [Pure Life Purified Eco-Shape Bottled Water](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="pure-life-purified-bottled-water-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pure-life-purified-bottled-water-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using Pure Life Purified Bottled Water in my daily life, I can't help but rave about its refreshing taste and environmentally friendly packaging. The unique blend of minerals added to the purified water truly sets it apart, making every sip a delightful experience. The Eco-shape bottle, made with 30 percent less plastic, not only contributes to reducing waste but also feels nice on my skin. 

One feature that deserves special mention is how easy it is to recycle these bottles. Their flexibility makes them incredibly easy to crush and dispose of responsibly. 

However, there is a minor downside to these water bottles - they are quite difficult to open. The safety seal and jagged edge on the cap can be quite challenging without using a rag or a bottle opener. This might not be a deal-breaker for some, but it's definitely worth considering if you prioritize convenience when choosing a water bottle. 

In conclusion, Pure Life Purified Bottled Water offers an exceptional balance of taste, quality, and eco-consciousness. It's perfect for those who want to stay hydrated while minimizing their environmental impact. I would highly recommend giving it a try, keeping in mind that its slightly tricky opening might be an inconvenience for some. 


### [Nestle 8 oz Pure Life Purified Bottled Water - 12 Pack](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="nestle-8-oz-pure-life-bottled-water-12-per-pack-pack-of-2-ne6639-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nestle-8-oz-pure-life-bottled-water-12-per-pack-pack-of-2-ne6639-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Nestle 8 oz Pure Life Bottled Water, and it has been a game-changer in my daily life. This refreshing drink has kept me hydrated throughout the day, especially when I'm running errands or hitting the gym. I was initially skeptical about the taste since I usually prefer flavorful drinks, but this water has a nice, distinctive taste that has won me over! 

One thing that amazed me about the Nestle Pure Life Bottle Water is how they managed to achieve a perfect balance of hydration and taste. Unlike other bottled waters I've tried, this one doesn't taste flat nor does it give that artificial aftertaste. I've also noticed that I'm craving sugary drinks less frequently since I've started using this product. 

However, the size of its container might be a downside for some. At 8 oz, it's not exactly a big bottle, so if you're used to large water bottles, you may have to carry more than one with you. Furthermore, the packaging is quite lightweight, which might not appeal to those who prefer sturdier bottles. 

So, should you try Nestle Pure Life Bottled Water? If you're looking for a healthier hydration alternative that doesn't compromise on taste, then absolutely! But be prepared to carry a few additional bottles if you need a larger amount of water throughout the day.

I used to be a big fan of Nestle's Pure Life water, but lately, I've had some mixed feelings. . The taste is still clean and refreshing, and the convenience of their bottling options is unbeatable. . 

However, I've noticed that the bottles seem less sturdy than before, making them a bit unwieldy if you're carrying multiple cases. . The real game-changer for me was when I found out that the water is now sourced from public water supplies rather than springs. . In terms of taste and quality, it's still water, but it's not the same experience I originally fell in love with from Pure Life. . 

I appreciate their commitment to sustainability and using recycled materials, but I might give a different brand a try in the future. . Overall, it's a decent water, but it has lost some of its charm for me. .

### [Nestle Pure Life Lemon Splash Water Beverage](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/pure-life-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="nestle-pure-life-water-beverage-lemon-splash-6-1pt-0-9-fl-oz-0-5-lt-bottles-3-qt-5-4-fl-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/nestle-pure-life-water-beverage-lemon-splash-6-1pt-0-9-fl-oz-0-5-lt-bottles-3-qt-5-4-fl-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Nestle Pure Life Water Beverage in Lemon Splash flavor, and it's been quite a journey. This lemon-flavored beverage boasts revitalizing tartness, making it a great way to help stay hydrated.

The packaging also deserves some praise. The 6-1pt 0.9 fl oz (0.5 lt) bottles are compact and easy to carry, making them ideal companions for on-the-go hydration. 

However, not everything is perfect. I've noticed that the lemon flavor, while refreshing, tends to leave a slightly artificial aftertaste that can detract from the overall enjoyment of the beverage.

In conclusion, Nestle Pure Life Water Beverage in Lemon Splash flavor offers a practical, hydrating, and guilt-free option. While the lemon flavor may not meet everyone's expectations for a natural, robust taste, it's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a low-calorie, flavorful way to stay hydrated.
