### [40 oz RTIC Road Trip Insulated Travel Mug](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="rtic-40-oz-road-trip-tumbler-double-walled-insulated-stainless-steel-portable-travel-coffee-mug-cup--1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rtic-40-oz-road-trip-tumbler-double-walled-insulated-stainless-steel-portable-travel-coffee-mug-cup--1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I am absolutely in love with my RTIC Road Trip Tumbler! This sleek and stylish tumbler has become an essential part of my daily routine, from my morning coffee runs to my afternoon jogs in the park. The double-walled insulation is a game-changer, keeping my hot drinks scalding hot and my iced drinks frostily cold for hours on end. It's not just great for coffee and tea, but also perfect for water on the go, making it an incredibly versatile addition to my collection of mugs and cups. 

The 3-in-1 Lid is one of my favorite features of this tumbler. It's amazing how seamlessly it transitions from closing off your drink completely, to allowing you to sip through a straw, to creating an opening for gulping down your beverage. The dual threading design caters perfectly to both lefties and righties, ensuring that everyone can comfortably enjoy their drink. Plus, the fact that two straws are included in the package sweetens the deal even further. 

However, there's one minor downside that I've encountered using this tumbler. The ceramic lining, although promoted as enhancing the taste of your drinks and simplifying the cleanup process, hasn't quite lived up to my expectations. I find that the stainless steel interior on some of my other mugs offers a slightly cleaner taste. Additionally, the lid and straw, while being leak-resistant, does have a bit of a learning curve. It takes some time to get used to the mechanism of opening and closing these components. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would highly recommend the RTIC Road Trip Tumbler to anyone in search of a reliable and stylish way to hydrate on the go. Its performance is truly top-notch, and the vibrant color options available make it a cinch to find a design that fits your personal style. So, go ahead and elevate your beverage game to the next level – the RTIC Road Trip Tumbler is definitely worth it!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="2-pack-rtic-18oz-stainless-steel-double-wall-vacuum-sealed-water-bottle-keeps-hot-cold-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/2-pack-rtic-18oz-stainless-steel-double-wall-vacuum-sealed-water-bottle-keeps-hot-cold-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Over the past few weeks, I've been using the 2 Pack RTIC 18oz Stainless Steel Double Wall Vacuum Sealed Water Bottle every single day. It's not just your ordinary water bottle - it's a beverage companion that keeps your hot drinks scorching and your cold drinks icy cold for hours on end. The vacuum insulation truly works its magic, ensuring your favorite brew stays warm and your chilled beverages chill without any compromise. 

The highlight of using this bottle is definitely its insulating prowess. It's a game-changer for on-the-go hydration or sipping your morning brew without worrying about it getting cold or watered down. The other feature that stood out is the screw-on lid with an integrated carrying handle. It's so easy to carry around, even when you've got your hands full. Plus, the bottle doesn't sweat or drip, which is a big plus to save your bag or car interior from becoming a mini-pool party. 

However, the bottom does seem to scratch the floor a little and there's no leak-proof guarantee, so be sure not to leave it on its side. Besides those minor quibbles, the 2 Pack RTIC Water Bottle has become a reliable companion, perfect for keeping hydrated or holding that hot tea in the morning. If you're looking for a tough, reliable bottle that keeps your drinks at their optimal temperature, this one does the job very well. 


### [32oz Bottle: Durable, Insulated, and Dishwasher Safe](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="rtic-32oz-bottle-white-matte-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rtic-32oz-bottle-white-matte-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The RTIC 32oz Bottle is my go-to for staying hydrated throughout the day. With its stainless steel construction and double wall vacuum insulation, it keeps my water ice-cold for hours on end. Plus, the no-sweat exterior ensures no mess or slippery hands. I also love its sleek, matte finish, which looks sophisticated and classy. 

One minor drawback is that its size limits how often I can fill up from smaller water sources during outdoor adventures. However, this is a small inconvenience compared to its many benefits. Overall, I highly recommend this water bottle for anyone looking for an effective and stylish way to stay hydrated.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/rtic-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="rtic-cub-kids-insulated-water-bottle-double-wall-vacuum-stainless-steel-drink-bottles-for-hot-cold-d-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/rtic-cub-kids-insulated-water-bottle-double-wall-vacuum-stainless-steel-drink-bottles-for-hot-cold-d-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the RTIC Cub Kids Insulated Water Bottle and I must say, it's been quite the adventure! This little bottle is perfect for my kiddo's small hands, and the double-walled vacuum insulation keeps their water cold for hours. The dishwasher-safe feature is a game-changer, making cleaning a breeze. Plus, I love the vibrant colors it comes in – it's like a fashion statement every time my little one drinks from it. 

However, there are some downsides to this bottle. The handle seems to be a weak point, as it tends to crack under even the slightest pressure. Also, the straw lid can be a bit tricky for my little one to use, as the suction design doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. 

Overall, the RTIC Cub Kids Insulated Water Bottle is a convenient and stylish choice for keeping your kids hydrated throughout the day. Just be cautious with the handle and straw lid, as they might not withstand the rough play of young explorers. So, if you're in the market for a children's water bottle, the RTIC Cub might be worth considering – just be prepared for a few potential hiccups along the way.

However, there are a couple of cons worth mentioning. Firstly, the lid doesn't seem to be the strongest part of the bottle. I've had a few instances where it's come off unexpectedly, which is not only inconvenient but also messy. Secondly, the bottle's size is quite large, making it a little difficult to fit into standard cup holders. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the RTIC 18oz Stainless Steel Bottle. Its excellent insulation capabilities and user-friendly features make it a must-have for anyone who's always on the go.
