### [S'well 17oz Galaxy Water Bottle: Stylish and Eco-Friendly](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="swell-17oz-galaxy-supernova-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-17oz-galaxy-supernova-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the S'well Galaxy Water Bottle and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. This sleek, stainless steel bottle is not just a pretty face with its lustrous finish - it's got some serious functionality going for it too. 

First off, the Thermas'well technology is truly impressive. I fill up my bottle with ice-cold water in the morning and by the time I'm halfway through my day, it's still just as refreshingly chilled. And for those winter days when I need a hot cuppa, this bottle keeps it steaming hot for hours on end. It's like having my personal thermos! 

One thing I really appreciate about this bottle is how eco-friendly it is. Made from BPA-free stainless steel, it's designed to be reused over and over again, reducing single-use plastic waste. Plus, S'well is a proud partner of UNICEF, contributing to clean water projects worldwide. 

In terms of usability, the screw cap is easy to twist on and off, even when your hands are wet or slippery. The wide mouth allows for easy sipping and accommodates ice cubes if you prefer your drinks extra cold. And despite its vacuum seal, taking a drink doesn't require any special technique or forceful effort. 

However, there are a few cons to note. For one, the bottle is quite heavy even when it's empty. While this doesn't bother me since I don't mind carrying a little extra weight, it might be an issue for someone who's looking for a lightweight option. Additionally, the triple-walled insulation can make it difficult to clean thoroughly. Using a small brush or pipe cleaner can help get rid of any residue buildup, but it's definitely more of a hassle than simply tossing it in the dishwasher (which isn't recommended anyway). 

All in all, I'm absolutely thrilled with my S'well Galaxy Water Bottle. Its beautiful design, top-notch insulation, and eco-friendly nature make it well worth the investment. Just remember to give it a good scrubbing every now and then, and you'll have a reliable and stylish companion for all your hydration needs. 


### [S'well 40 oz. Onyx Stainless Steel Travel Mug](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="swell-40-oz-onyx-stainless-steel-traveler-triple-layered-vacuum-insulated-bottle-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-40-oz-onyx-stainless-steel-traveler-triple-layered-vacuum-insulated-bottle-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the S'well 40 oz. Onyx Stainless Steel Traveler Triple-Layered Vacuum-Insulated Bottle for a while now, and I must say, it has truly changed my hydration game. The most notable feature is its excellent insulation ability - I can fill it with ice-cold water in the morning and still have chill water 12 hours later. 

The size is just perfect for me. It’s not too large, but it holds enough water to keep me hydrated throughout the day. Also, the wide-mouth opening is a game-changer. It makes refilling and cleaning the bottle much easier than traditional narrow-mouth bottles. 

I must mention the silicone handle. It's soft and comfortable to hold, and it does not slip even when my hands are sweaty. However, it does not fit into standard car cup holders, which can be inconvenient for some. 

The bottle is made from high-quality food-grade stainless steel, which makes it sturdy and BPA-free. But it's not dishwasher safe, so I have to clean it by hand, which can be a little cumbersome. 

All in all, the S'well 40 oz. Stainless Steel Traveler Triple-Layered Vacuum-Insulated Bottle has been an excellent addition to my daily routine. Its impressive insulation capability, user-friendly design, and good looks make it worth every penny. 


### [Blue Suede 17 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle by S'well](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="swell-bottle-blue-suede-17-oz-stainless-steel-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-bottle-blue-suede-17-oz-stainless-steel-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

So, let me tell you about this amazing S'well bottle (the Blue Suede 17 oz one) I've been using daily. It's this sleek stainless steel water bottle that's not only great for looking cool but also super functional. 

The thing I love the most about this bottle is how it keeps my drinks cold for hours and hours. No matter how hot it is outside, my water stays ice-cold, the same as when I first filled it. If you're a fan of hot beverages, I'm told it does an equally good job at keeping them warm. However, I haven't tested that out personally. 

The bottle's construction is high-grade 18/8 stainless steel, which means it's super durable. I've been using it every day and haven't noticed any dents or scratches yet. It's also BPA-free and toxic-free, which is a huge plus for me. 

The only downside I've noticed is that it's a bit on the heavier side, even when it's empty. But that's not a deal-breaker for me, especially when I consider how well it performs. 

As for the maintenance, the bottle is hand wash only, but that's not a big issue. Just remember to clean it often, especially the cap and rim, to keep it fresh and free from any bacteria buildup. 

Overall, I'm super satisfied with my S'well bottle. It's a great companion for my daily activities, from the gym to running errands around town. If you're looking for a high-quality, well-insulated water bottle that will keep your drinks at the perfect temperature, you should definitely give this one a try! 


### [S'ip by S'well Insulated Water Bottle - 15 oz](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="sip-by-swell-15-oz-water-bottle-cotton-candy-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/sip-by-swell-15-oz-water-bottle-cotton-candy-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the S'ip by S'well Cotton Candy Blue Water Bottle, and it's quickly becoming my go-to in my daily routine. This little bottle is perfect for keeping your beverages either hot or cold for hours on end. 

I love how stylish and colorful it is, making it a perfect companion for both work and play. It's also incredibly easy to use and clean, with a screw-on cap that prevents any spills or leaks. 

One of the standout features of this bottle is its triple-walled construction, which ensures excellent insulation and keeps your drinks at their ideal temperature. And let me tell you, this thing delivers in spades! 

On the downside, the opening of the bottle is quite small, making it a bit difficult to clean thoroughly. Additionally, since it's made of stainless steel, there's a slight metallic taste that some people might not like. 

Overall, the S'ip by S'well Cotton Candy Blue Water Bottle is a fantastic addition to anyone's daily routine. Its good looks and excellent insulation make it a must-have for staying hydrated, whether you're at the office or out on a hike. 


### [Stylish and Durable 40 oz S'well Roamer Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/swell-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="swell-40-oz-onyx-roamer-bottle-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/swell-40-oz-onyx-roamer-bottle-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast, I've tried countless water bottles over the years, but none compare to the S'well 40-Oz. Onyx Roamer Bottle. This sleek, stainless steel behemoth keeps your drinks hot for up to 12 hours and cold for a whopping 24 hours, making it the perfect companion for long hikes or adventurous day trips. 

I first discovered the Roamer while exploring the rugged trails of Yosemite National Park. As the sun bore down on us, my trusty Roamer continued to keep my water ice-cold and refreshing. The vacuum-insulated construction truly sets this bottle apart from the competition, ensuring that you'll never have to deal with lukewarm beverages on the trail again. 

One feature that I particularly appreciated was the screw-off lid, which made refilling and cleaning a breeze. The sleek silhouette and condensation-free exterior also contributed to its overall portability, ensuring that my hands stayed dry and comfortable even during intense hikes. 

However, like any product, there were some minor drawbacks. The most significant issue I encountered was the small carry handle at the top of the bottle, which felt a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the high-quality construction. Additionally, due to its size and weight, it might not be the most practical choice for those who prefer lightweight gear. 

Despite these minor cons, I wholeheartedly recommend the S'well 40-Oz. Onyx Roamer Bottle for anyone seeking a reliable, durable, and effective way to stay hydrated on their outdoor adventures.
