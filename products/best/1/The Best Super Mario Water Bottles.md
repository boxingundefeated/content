<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/super-mario-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="stor-400ml-kids-aluminium-bottle-super-mario-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stor-400ml-kids-aluminium-bottle-super-mario-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Stor Super Mario Aluminium Water Bottle for my little one, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. This super Mario bottle not only boasts a fun and playful design that keeps my kid excited about hydrating but also makes me feel good knowing it's made from lightweight aluminium. 

One of the standout features of this bottle is its size. The 400ml capacity is just right for keeping my little mario fan hydrated during playtime or long trips. Plus, it's light enough for him to carry around and handle with ease. 

The material used in this bottle is another pro. When manufacturing their products, Stor employs only BPA-free materials, which means I don't have to worry about harmful chemicals leaching into my child's drinking water. 

On the flip side, there's one minor con that I've noticed. The aluminium can get dented if knocked against hard surfaces. But overall, this hasn't deterred us from using it as part of our daily routine. 

In conclusion, if you're looking for a fun, practical, and safe water bottle for your kid's adventures, consider giving the Stor Super Mario Aluminium Water Bottle a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/super-mario-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="super-mario-bros-beacon-stainless-steel-insulated-kids-water-bottle-with-covered-spout-20-ounces-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/super-mario-bros-beacon-stainless-steel-insulated-kids-water-bottle-with-covered-spout-20-ounces-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Super Mario Bros. Beacon Stainless Steel Insulated Kids Water Bottle, and it's been a game-changer for my little one's hydration goals. First off, the Mario movie design is a definite hit with my son - he's always been a big fan of the Italian plumber. The 20oz size is perfect for his active lifestyle, and the wide carrying handle makes it easy for him to grab and go. 

One feature that really stands out is the rubberized bottom bumper. I was initially skeptic about how well it would protect the bottle from sliding off desks or tables, but I've been pleasantly surprised. It has managed to keep our kitchen table free of water spills and prevented any scratches or dings on the floor. 

Aside from its practicality, this bottle is also incredibly stylish. My son loves showing off the raddest characters on the planet, but you can also customize it with your own stickers and paint to add a personal touch. Plus, the antimicrobial drinking spout ensures that his bottle stays clean and free of germs. 

However, no product is perfect, and there are a few downsides to consider. The pop-up lid can be a bit difficult to open and close at times, which might frustrate younger kids. Additionally, some users have reported issues with the silicone ring at the bottom, including one reviewer who lost two already. 

Despite these minor flaws, I believe that this Super Mario Bros. Beacon Stainless Steel Insulated Kids Water Bottle is an excellent choice for any child who wants to stay hydrated while looking cool. The combination of durability, insulation, and eye-catching design make it a worthwhile investment for any parent looking to keep their kid's life running smoothly.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/super-mario-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="skater-2way-stainless-steel-water-bottle-super-mario-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/skater-2way-stainless-steel-water-bottle-super-mario-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Skater 2-way Stainless Steel Water Bottle from Super Mario" has become an essential part of my daily life. I've been using it for weeks now, and it's been serving me quite well. The 2-way nature of the bottle — allowing for direct drinking or through the cap — is a game-changer. It's convenient, efficient, and just a lot of fun to use. 

One feature that stands out for me is the bottle's size. It's just about perfect; not too big, not too small. I can carry it comfortably in my bag and it fits perfectly in most cup holders in cars. Another highlight is the direct drinking feature. It's so easy to use, especially when I'm on the go. I don't even need to twist the cap, just pull up and take a sip. 

However, there are a couple of things that could be improved. The locking mechanism on the bottle's cap can be a bit tricky at times. It requires a forceful push to unlock, which can be a bit challenging when you're in a hurry. Also, the bottle cap doesn't completely twist off, which makes it a bit difficult to clean thoroughly. 

Overall, the Skater 2-way Stainless Steel Water Bottle from Super Mario is a fantastic product. It's perfect for people who are always on the go and need a reliable water bottle. The unique design and sturdy build make it a joy to use. I highly recommend it. 


### [Thermos FunTainer Mario Kart Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/super-mario-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/super-mario-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="thermos-mario-kart-12oz-funtainer-water-bottle-with-bail-handle-red-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/thermos-mario-kart-12oz-funtainer-water-bottle-with-bail-handle-red-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a long-time user of Thermos' FUNtainer products, I can attest to their quality and performance. The 12oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle is no exception, featuring a visually appealing design that kids will love and practical features that parents will appreciate. 

One standout feature is the double-wall vacuum insulation, which kept my drinks cold for hours on end during hot summer days. The bottle's stainless steel interior and exterior add to its durability, making it capable of withstanding even the most rigorous use from energetic kids. 

The integrated carry handle is another great feature, providing an easy and secure grip for small hands while also being able to fold down when not in use. This design allowed my children to carry their water bottles around effortlessly throughout the day without losing them. 

However, one aspect that could use improvement is the lid's leak-proof capability. Although it did a decent job of keeping spills at bay, we found that if the lid was not closed properly or knocked over, some leakage could occur. Regular maintenance and care can help prevent this issue. 

In conclusion, the Thermos 12oz FUNtainer Water Bottle with Bail Handle is a fantastic option for parents seeking a reliable, insulated water bottle for their kids. Its durable design, comfortable grip, and visually appealing graphics make it a hit with both kids and parents alike. Just be sure to handle the lid properly to prevent any potential leakage!
