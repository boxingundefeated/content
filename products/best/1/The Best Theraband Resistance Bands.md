In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable, portable, and effective resistance band to incorporate into your workout routine or physical therapy program, the Theraband Non-Latex Resistance Bands are definitely worth considering.

Plus, the color-coded scheme is not only fun but also makes it super simple to choose the right band for your current fitness level. 

I've also noticed that these bands feel more durable than other resistance bands I've used before. Even after months of regular use, they're showing no signs of stretching out or breaking down. And when they're not in use? They roll up nice and tight, so they take up virtually no space in my gym bag. 

On the downside, I've had a couple of friends tell me that the bands can be a bit tricky to hold onto during certain exercises.
