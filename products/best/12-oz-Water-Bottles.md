I recently got a Thermos FUNtainer for my little one and have been pleasantly surprised. The 12-ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw has been a game-changer in keeping their drinks cold and fresh all day long. What I particularly love about it is its ability to maintain the temperature of the liquid for up to 12 hours. I remember one time when my child went to school with ice in their bottle, and it was still icy cold at lunchtime! 

The child-friendly design is also worth mentioning. The double wall stainless steel construction can easily handle rough-and-tumble play without breaking a sweat. And when it comes to cleaning, you'll be relieved to know that this bottle is dishwasher-safe, although handwashing is recommended for optimum results. However, please note that this bottle isn't meant for using with hot liquids. 

On the downside, some reviews mentioned leakage issues when the bottle isn't closed properly. But as long as you ensure the lid is securely closed, you shouldn't have any problems. Additionally, the bottle might be smaller than what some people expect, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a larger capacity bottle. 

Overall, the Thermos FUNtainer is a perfect blend of fun and function, making it an excellent choice for parents who want to encourage their kids to stay hydrated throughout the day. It's well-made, easy to clean, and visually appealing, making it a great addition to any kid's lunchbox or to keep within easy reach during school or playtime. 

In conclusion, the Thermos FUNtainer has been a reliable companion in our quest to keep our children hydrated and happy. Despite its minor shortcomings, we believe it's worth considering for parents looking for a durable and efficient water bottle for their young ones.

I recently discovered the RTIC Outdoors 12-fl oz Stainless Steel Insulated Cup and it's become my go-to companion for beach trips and barbecues.

However, some users have reported issues with the cup fitting certain types of bottles, such as those from Sierra Nevada or Lagunitas. Additionally, the white version of the cup has been known to have the bottom fall off occasionally. Despite these minor drawbacks, overall, I've found the RTIC Outdoors 12-fl oz Stainless Steel Insulated Cup to be a reliable and stylish addition to my outdoor gear collection.

Thanks to its ceramic coating, there's none of that unpleasant metallic taste you get with most reusable bottles.

I've been using it as my morning coffee companion, filling it up with my freshly brewed joe before heading out to face the day. Even after hours at work, my coffee is still sizzling hot and ready for my afternoon pick-me-up. 

Its leakproof lid gives me peace of mind that I can toss this bottle into my bag without worrying about spills, making it an excellent choice for those on the go. The sleek, non-slip silicone grip and soft-touch lid offer ultimate portability, making the Porter bottle a perfect companion for hikes, road trips, and any other adventures life throws at you. 

Worried about fitting this gem into your standard car cup holder? Fear not! The 12 oz. size fits perfectly under most coffee machines and in laptop bags, while the 16 oz. and 20 oz. options are perfect for large smoothies or your daily iced coffee fix. 

In terms of material, this bottle features a ceramic-coated stainless steel frame, which is both environmentally friendly and LFGB-certified silicone for added safety. Its dishwasher-safe design makes for easy cleaning, allowing you to keep the bottle fresh and spotless. 

So, if you're in the market for a stylish, high-performing, and versatile reusable bottle, the Porter bottle is definitely worth considering. With its ability to maintain temperature, leakproof design, and unbeatable grip, it's a must-have accessory for anyone looking to stay hydrated on-the-go without sacrificing taste or style.

### [Insulated Tea and Coffee Bottle, Ceramic Coated - Cloudy Grey](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/12-oz-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/12-oz-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="que-12-oz-insulated-bottle-cloudy-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/que-12-oz-insulated-bottle-cloudy-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The double-wall insulation does an amazing job of keeping my beverages hot for up to 12 hours and cold for a solid 24 hours - talk about impressive! The ceramic coating is another huge plus, as it prevents any unwanted metallic taste from affecting my drinks. 

One aspect I truly appreciate is the gently curved, soft-touch exterior. It's incredibly comfortable to hold, and the non-slip silicone bottom ensures that it stays securely in place, even during those hectic morning rushes. However, I do wish there was an option for a vertical orientation, as it sometimes feels a tad bulky to carry around. 

The only minor drawback I've encountered is that it doesn't fit standard car cup holders. While this might not be an issue for everyone, it does make it slightly more difficult to take my bottle on-the-go without worrying about spills while driving. 

Overall, the Que 12 oz. Insulated Bottle in Cloudy Grey has been a fantastic addition to my daily life, helping me stay hydrated with its excellent insulation and taste-enhancing ceramic coating. The comfortable grip and non-slip bottom make it incredibly user-friendly, and the stylish design has received numerous compliments from my friends and family.

My kids adore these bottles because they can choose from a variety of colors, making them feel like they have their own personalized bottle. The leakproof feature has also saved us from any unwanted spills in the car, during sports games, or on school trips.

### [12 oz Cub Bottle – Green Camp Dinos](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/12-oz-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

However, there have been a few hiccups along the way. The lid handle, while sturdy, can crack under excessive force, which has led to some frustration. Additionally, the straw lid can be a bit difficult to clean, especially if you're using it with thicker, milk-based beverages.

### [Thermos 12oz Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Straw](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/12-oz-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

As a parent and avid product reviewer, I was excited to try out the Thermos Funtainer Bottle for my kids. We've been using it for a few weeks now, and I must say, it has been a game-changer on hot summer days. The first thing that stood out to me was its design. It's sleek and stylish, with vibrant colors that my kids absolutely love. 

One of the highlights of this bottle is its ability to keep drinks cold for up to 12 hours. I filled it with ice water during a family picnic, and even after several hours, the water was still refreshingly cold. This feature is especially useful for those long days when we're out and about. 

The stainless steel interior and exterior are also worth mentioning. The sturdy construction makes me feel confident that it can withstand the rough and tumble world of a child's daily life. Plus, the built-in carry handle means my kids can easily carry it around without any assistance. 

However, there are a couple of cons to consider. First, the bottle is not suitable for hot liquids, which might be a deal-breaker for some families. Second, while the hygienic push-button lid with pop-up straw is a great idea in theory, it can be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly. 

In summary, the Thermos Funtainer Bottle has proven to be a reliable companion for keeping our drinks cold throughout the day. Its sturdy construction, stylish design, and effective insulation make it a worthwhile investment for families with active kids. Just be aware of its limitations with hot liquids and prepare for some extra effort in cleaning the lid.

As a mom of three, staying hydrated is a constant challenge for my kids. We recently purchased the Ozark Trail 12 oz Kids Water Bottle and it's quickly become our go-to choice for school, sports, and play!

The 12 oz capacity is perfect for my kids, ensuring they stay hydrated without having to carry around a heavy bottle. 

One feature that we absolutely love is the straw cap. Not only is it leak-proof (a massive plus! ), but it's also ultra-shatter resistant, providing peace of mind knowing that we won't have to constantly replace broken parts. Additionally, the food-grade stainless steel construction ensures that there's no metallic taste, and the double-wall vacuum insulation and No Sweat Design keep drinks cold or hot for extended periods. 

However, one potential downside of this water bottle is the straw setup. Some users, including myself, found it to be slightly inconvenient when trying to drink directly from the bottle without using the straw. Another minor issue we encountered was the fixed angle of the handle, which made it slightly awkward to use, especially when trying to open or close the lid. 

Overall, the Ozark Trail 12 oz Kids Water Bottle is a reliable and functional option that has become an essential part of our daily routine.

### How do I choose the best 12 oz water bottle for me?

When choosing a 12 oz water bottle, consider factors such as material, insulation, design, and ease of use. Think about your personal preferences and lifestyle needs. For example, if you're looking for a lightweight and affordable option, a plastic bottle may be ideal. If you prioritize eco-friendliness, a glass or stainless steel bottle would be a better choice. Additionally, consider whether you need an insulated bottle to keep water cold or hot for extended periods.
