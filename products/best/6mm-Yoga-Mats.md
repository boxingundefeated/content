### [Thick Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat with Bonus Workout](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-lily-shadows-print-yoga-mat-6-mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-lily-shadows-print-yoga-mat-6-mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got myself a Gaiam Premium Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat because I wanted to take my practice up a notch. This isn't your regular yoga mat - it's extra-thick and provides superior cushioning for my joints. The first thing that struck me when I unrolled it was its beautiful design; the vibrant colors are lovely to look at. 

One of the most notable features of this mat is its non-slip surface. It gives excellent traction, keeping me steady even during the most challenging poses. The thickness also plays a significant role in enhancing my comfort during yoga sessions. 

However, there's one slight downside - if you sweat a lot like me, the mat can get slightly slippery. So, if you're a heavy sweater, you might want to consider a dry-grip mat. 

Another highlight worth mentioning is that it's free of six common phthalates, making it safer for use. Plus, you get a free yoga workout download, which adds extra value to the product. 

All in all, I'm quite happy with my purchase. The Gaiam Premium Lily Shadows Print Yoga Mat has not only enhanced my yoga experience but also added a touch of vibrancy to my practice space. If you're looking for a high-quality yoga mat that offers both comfort and style, this one is definitely worth considering.

### [Sublime Sky 6mm Premium Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-sublime-sky-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-sublime-sky-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam Sublime Sky yoga mat and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily practice. The calming colors provide just the right amount of inspiration to help me stay focused and motivated during my sessions. 

One thing that really stood out to me is the mat's thickness. At 6mm, it offers supreme cushioning without sacrificing stability. This feature has made all the difference for me, especially when performing poses that require more flexibility or weight-bearing. 

However, not everything about the mat was perfect. There were some instances where the surface felt too soft and compressed, making it difficult to maintain proper alignment and balance. While this issue may not affect everyone, it certainly impacted my experience with the mat. 

Another aspect worth mentioning is the mat's portability. Its lightweight design makes it easy to bring along to classes or carry around during travel. And speaking of classes, the free yoga class bonus that comes with the mat was a nice added touch. 

In terms of its construction, the mat is made of latex-free PVC that's free of harmful phthalates. This ensures a safe and healthy practice environment while also contributing to the mat's incredible durability. 

Overall, I've had a mostly positive experience with the Gaiam Sublime Sky yoga mat. The combination of its thickness, attractiveness, and ease of portability make it a valuable addition to my home practice. While there are some minor drawbacks worth considering, I would still recommend this mat to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish option for their yoga sessions. 


### [Reversible, Non-Slip Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-reversible-yoga-mat-boho-folk-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-reversible-yoga-mat-boho-folk-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam Premium Print Reversible Yoga Mat for my home yoga practice, and I couldn't be happier. The moment I laid it out on my studio floor, I knew I had chosen well. 

The first thing that caught my eye about this mat is its unique design. With two beautiful patterns to choose from, it's like having two mats in one! Not only does this add visual appeal to my practice space, but it also inspires me to keep trying new poses and routines. Additionally, the patterns have helped me with my alignment during some more advanced poses. 

The thickness of the mat, at 6mm, provides just the right amount of cushioning without sacrificing stability. Whether I'm practicing on hardwood floors or tiles, the mat doesn't slip or slide, giving me peace of mind knowing I won't lose focus during my practice. 

One feature that I've found especially useful is the textured surface that offers excellent grip. Even when I'm working up a sweat, my hands and feet remain firmly planted on the mat, allowing me to maintain proper form and balance throughout my practice. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this mat. Firstly, it does have a mild odor upon first opening, which can be off-putting. But after following the recommendations to air it out for a couple of days, the smell dissipates considerably. 

Secondly, some users may find the smell of the mat to be bothersome even after it has been aired out. If you have a sensitive sense of smell, this might not be the ideal mat for you. 

In conclusion, the Gaiam Premium Print Reversible Yoga Mat has quickly become one of my favorite fitness accessories. Its attractive design, comfortable thickness, and excellent grip make it perfect for both beginners and experienced yogis alike. While the initial odor may be a turnoff for some, its overall performance and quality make it worth considering as your go-to yoga mat. 


### [Stylish Luminary Yoga Mat with Citron Sundial Print](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-luminary-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-premium-yoga-mat-luminary-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When it comes to finding the right yoga mat, I have tried quite a few. But the one that stands out for me is the Gaiam 6mm Luminary Premium Yoga Mat. As an avid yoga practitioner, I know how important it is to have a comfortable and durable mat that provides excellent grip. 

One day, I remember walking into my local yoga studio and saw this mat. It immediately caught my eye with its beautiful Citron Sundial print. I thought to myself, "Wow, this would look great in my home practice space. " And boy, was I right! 

The first thing I noticed about this mat was its thickness - 6mm. Now, I've dealt with some thin mats before, and they just don't provide enough cushioning for my joints during practice. But with this mat, I no longer feel the hard floor beneath me as much, allowing me to focus more on my flows and less on the pain in my knees. 

Another feature that I absolutely love is the non-slip texture. This helps me maintain my balance during tricky poses, especially when I'm sweaty from a hot yoga class. Plus, the fact that it's made from latex-free PVC gives me peace of mind knowing I'm using an eco-friendly option without any harmful chemicals. 

However, there are a couple of downsides to this mat. Firstly, while it does provide good cushioning, some users might find it too soft, as it may compress easily under body weight. Additionally, since the mat is quite large, it may be difficult to pack it away for travel purposes. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase of the Gaiam 6mm Luminary Premium Yoga Mat. Its beautiful design, excellent grip, and comfortable cushioning make it a valuable addition to any yogi's collection.

I also appreciate that the mat is easy to clean and quite portable. 

While the initial smell of the mat may be a concern for some, airing it out or using some essential oils can effectively combat this issue. Some users have reported experiencing slipperiness during intense workouts, but this can be addressed by using a towel for extra grip. Overall, the Gaiam Peaceful Waters yoga mat offers excellent value for its features and performance, making it a worthwhile investment for any yoga enthusiast. 


## Buyer's Guide

### Considerations for Different Yoga Styles

Different yoga styles may require unique features in a yoga mat: 

* Vinyasa Flow and Ashtanga: Lightweight and easy-to-clean mats offer better portability for classes at different locations.

* Yin and Restorative: A thicker mat (around 8mm) can provide extra cushioning and support during slower, more meditative practices.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Proper care ensures your 6mm yoga mat lasts longer and maintains optimal performance:

To maintain your mat's grip, avoid using harsh chemicals, and avoid storing it in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. 


### What materials are typically used in 6mm yoga mats?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/6mm-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/6mm+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="6mm Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

### Can I use a 6mm yoga mat for other forms of exercise?

While 6mm yoga mats are designed primarily for yoga practices, they can also be used for other low-impact exercises like Pilates or stretching. The cushioning and grip provided by a 6mm mat can help make these activities more comfortable and enjoyable. However, if you participate in more intense workouts, such as high-impact cardio, you may want to consider a separate exercise mat with more shock absorption and traction. 


### How do I store my 6mm yoga mat properly?

After your practice, wipe down your mat and allow it to air dry completely. Once it's dry, roll it up with the top of the mat facing outwards. This helps prevent dirt, dust, and debris from accumulating on the surface. Store your mat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. If you'll be traveling with your mat, consider investing in a yoga mat bag for easy transportation and protection.
