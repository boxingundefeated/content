### [CALPAK Stevyn Walnut Duffel Bag with Shoe Compartment](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brown-gym-bags?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brown-gym-bags?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="stevyn-duffel-calpak-walnut-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/stevyn-duffel-calpak-walnut-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of using the CALPAK Walnut duffel bag as my go-to carry-on for a short trip. The large bottom compartment provided ample space for my shoes and even some extra organizational pockets, making it perfect for both weekends at the gym or as a light travel bag. 

One of the most notable features was its shoe compartment, which allowed me to pack more than just my everyday sneakers. The capacity was impressive, fitting everything comfortably without feeling overstuffed. Its weight was manageable too, letting me carry it with ease even during long walks. 

However, what stood out the most was the design comfort. Despite its size, this duffel bag felt comfortable and secure on my shoulder. The adjustable strap was a nice touch, giving me the flexibility to adjust according to my needs. 

On the downside, I encountered some water resistance issues. During some light rainfall, I noticed a few damp spots on the surface of the bag. Fortunately, the interior remained dry thanks to the water-resistant material used in its construction. 

All in all, the CALPAK Walnut duffel bag has been a reliable companion during my travels. Its blend of functionality and style makes it an attractive option for anyone looking for a durable and spacious duffel bag. 


### [Lands' End Waxed Cotton Canvas Travel Duffle Bag](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brown-gym-bags?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/brown-gym-bags?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="lands-end-waxed-canvas-travel-duffle-bag-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lands-end-waxed-canvas-travel-duffle-bag-brown-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Lands' End Waxed Canvas Travel Duffle Bag for a few months now, and I've got to say it's been a game-changer for me. Not only does it look good with its high-quality leather accents and waxed cotton canvas exterior, but it also feels great to carry around. This bag has been with me on countless trips and has held up against even the roughest of travel conditions. 

However, there are a few issues that have come up along the way. Firstly, the internal storage options could be better. I find myself struggling to keep my smaller items organized within the bag, which can sometimes make finding things a bit of a challenge. Secondly, the bag isn't as water-resistant as I would've liked. This has been particularly problematic during rainy trips when I've had to stuff my wet clothes back into the bag. 

In terms of size and weight, the duffle bag is perfect for short trips or as a carry-on for flights. It's not too bulky, making it easy to carry around and store when not in use. Additionally, the removable, padded shoulder strap is a great feature that allows me to adjust the bag to my preferred carrying style. 

Overall, I'm happy with my Lands' End Waxed Canvas Travel Duffle Bag. It's a well-made, attractive bag that has proven to be durable and reliable, despite some minor issues. If you're in the market for a new travel duffle bag, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try.
