<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/clear-water-bottle-with-straw?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="12-pack-18-5oz-plastic-bottle-with-straw-by-celebrate-it-other-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/12-pack-18-5oz-plastic-bottle-with-straw-by-celebrate-it-other-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once I got my hands on this Clear Water Bottle with Straw by Celebrate It, I knew I had to give it a try. With its sleek design and the ability to decorate it with decals, I could see the potential for some fun DIY projects. My first thought was to create a shaker tumbler - a trending idea I had seen online. 

However, the large gap between the double-walled inside near the lid wasn't ideal. The glitter settled around the rim instead of staying in the center, and worst of all, the glycerine kept seeping out from the top. It was a disappointment to see this beautiful tumbler go to waste. 

On the other hand, using this tumbler for my daily water intake has helped me stay hydrated without consuming too much plastic. And with the straw, I find myself drinking more water than I would from a regular cup. It's tall and slim, which makes it easy to store in tight spaces or carry in my bag. Plus, the ability to customize it with stickers adds a personalized touch that I love. 

Some users have reported poor quality, with the bottles cracking or having leaks. While it could be possible that a batch of defective products had slipped through the cracks, I would recommend testing these tumblers for leaks before filling them up with your artwork. 

Overall, the Clear Water Bottle with Straw can be an attractive option for those who want to make their DIY tumblers more personalized. Just be sure to inspect the bottle thoroughly for any signs of defects before investing your time and supplies in a project.
