### [Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle and has been a game-changer in my daily life. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design and color. It's not only attractive but also made with high-quality materials, giving me the assurance of durability. The angled straw is a unique feature that I absolutely love. It allows me to effortlessly sip every last drop of water without tilting the bottle, making it super convenient for on-the-go drinking. 

One of the key highlights of this bottle is its carbon fiber filter technology, which reduces up to 99% of chlorine taste and odor. This has greatly improved the taste of the water, making it more enjoyable to drink. The filter lasts for about 3-5 months, which is quite decent considering its performance. 

The Contigo Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle also impresses with its leakproof design. The no-leak autospout lid ensures that there are no spills in my car or wherever I take it. And when it comes to convenience, the integrated carry handle and one-handed drinking feature make it incredibly easy to carry and use. 

Cleaning the bottle is also a breeze as the lid and body are dishwasher-safe. The filter, however, needs to be rinsed with water only. The SIP CLEANER cover ensures that the drink spout stays protected from dirt and grime. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle. Its innovative features like the carbon fiber filter technology, angled straw, and no-leak autospout lid make it stand out from other water bottles in the market. It's definitely worth the investment, especially if you're looking for a stylish and functional water bottle that can improve the taste of your water significantly. 


### [24 oz Contigo Ashland Water Bottle for One-Handed Drinking and Leak-Proof Lid](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-water-bottle-ashland-scuba-24-ounce-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-water-bottle-ashland-scuba-24-ounce-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a Contigo Ashland 24-ounce water bottle and I must say, it's been quite the companion! Its sleek design and easy-to-use features make it the perfect addition to my daily routine. The best part? It's leak-proof when locked, so no more unexpected waterfalls in my bag. 

The easy-to-use drinking spout is a game-changer for those who prefer one-handed hydration. Even better, the protective spout cover keeps out dirt and germs, making every sip feel cleaner. I find it especially useful during my morning jogs when my hands are all occupied with my phone or keys. 

One feature that stands out is the button lock. It gives me an added sense of security, knowing that my bottle won't accidentally open up in my bag or during a workout. And the stainless steel construction ensures durability, even after several rough uses. 

However, this bottle does lack double-wall insulation, which means it isn't as effective at keeping drinks cold for extended periods. Additionally, some users reported issues with the pressure buildup in the bottle, leading to unexpected sprays when opening the straw. But overall, these minor flaws don't overshadow the convenience and quality that the Contigo Ashland Water Bottle offers. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a reliable, easy-to-use water bottle that keeps your drinks secure and spill-free, look no further than the Contigo Ashland. Its innovative design and practical features make it a top contender in the world of hydration solutions.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-ashland-2-0-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-2-pack-juniper-sake-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-ashland-2-0-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-2-pack-juniper-sake-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a Contigo Ashland 2.0 Water Bottle with Autospout Lid 2-Pack, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily hydration routine. The first thing that struck me about this water bottle was its sleek design. The Juniper and Sake color combination was quite attractive and added a pop of color to my bag. 

One feature that I absolutely love is the push-button AutoSpout technology which makes it incredibly easy to drink from the bottle with just one hand. And the best part? It's leakproof! There's nothing more frustrating than a water bottle that leaks all over your stuff, but this little gem has kept my bag dry and my belongings safe. 

Another standout feature is the spout cover. I'm really impressed by how well it protects the spout from dirt and grime. Plus, the button lock ensures that the spout doesn't accidentally pop up which would inevitably lead to messy situations. 

However, there's one minor issue that I've encountered. The straw can sometimes come loose and cause leakage. This is particularly noticeable when the bottle is tipped on its side or upside down. But don't worry, a quick twist of the screw on the lid usually takes care of it. 

All in all, the Contigo Ashland 2.0 Water Bottle with Autospout Lid has made staying hydrated throughout the day so much easier. Its sleek design, easy-to-use features, and leakproof capabilities make it a top contender in my book. Despite the small straw issue, I give this product a solid 4 out of 5 stars. 


### [Contigo 32 oz. Ashland 2.0 Tritan Water Bottle with Autospout Lid - Dragon Fruit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-32-oz-ashland-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-dragon-fruit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-32-oz-ashland-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-dragon-fruit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Contigo 32 oz. Ashland 2.0 Tritan Water Bottle with Autospout Lid in Dragon Fruit color, and I must say, it's been a refreshing experience. This bottle is one of those products that make hydrating yourself a little more fun. The Autospout technology is truly a game-changer in preventing spills, and I personally love how the spout pops up for easy drinking from the straw, then seals back down for no leaks. 

One of the standout features for me is the sip cleaner, which acts as a spout cover protecting it from dirt and grime. It gives me peace of mind that I'm drinking from a clean surface. Plus, the button lock ensures the spout doesn't open accidentally during my adventures - a fantastic safety feature! 

However, there are some cons too. I did find the bottle to be a bit heavy when full, which can be inconvenient for long hikes or runs. Additionally, despite the integrated handle that's supposed to make carrying this bottle easier and more comfortable, I still think it could be better designed for maximum hand comfort. Lastly, the bottle tends to accumulate water marks and stains on the outside over time, making it look a bit less appealing. 

In conclusion, while the Contigo Ashland Water Bottle does an excellent job at keeping you well-hydrated due to its push-button technology and leak-proof design, it has a few minor drawbacks that could be improved upon. Overall, I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars rating. 


### [Contigo Ashland Leak-Proof Water Bottle with Protective Spout Cover - Passion Fruit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-autospout-ashland-water-bottle-passion-fruit-720-ml-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-autospout-ashland-water-bottle-passion-fruit-720-ml-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Contigo Ashland is an elegant water bottle designed to make your life easier. It's great for daily use - whether you're at work, during exercise or just hanging out at home. The AUTOSPOUT feature makes it convenient to drink from it in any situation. The soft silicone mouthpiece is kept clean and protected from germs thanks to its locking mechanism. Close it as usual by simply aligning the button and the drinking spout, and you have a leak-proof bottle. 

One thing I noticed was the bottle's sleek and stylish design. Not only does it look good, but it also has a clip attached to the handle, making it perfect for attaching to rucksacks or bags when you're on the go. The unique diagonal straw design ensures you can drink every last drop. 

However, some people mention issues with leakiness, and the bottle's spout can sometimes shoot out water. While this isn't a major problem, it might need a little getting used to. 

Cleaning the bottle is a breeze - just put the lid, straw, and bottle body in the dishwasher. I've been using this bottle daily for a few weeks now, and it's become an essential part of my routine. I love the convenience of the AUTOSPOUT feature, and the bottle's sleek design is just a bonus. 

Despite minor concerns about occasional leakiness and the spout's behavior, I'd still recommend the Contigo Ashland for anyone looking for a reliable, easy-to-use water bottle. With its stylish design, ease of use, and convenient cleaning features, it's worth trying out. 


### [Large Capacity 40 oz. Contigo AutoSeal Water Bottle for Hands-Free Sipping](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-40-oz-cortland-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autoseal-lid-licorice-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-40-oz-cortland-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autoseal-lid-licorice-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Contigo 40 oz. Cortland Water Bottle for a few months now and it has become a staple in my daily life. The Autoseal Lid is a game-changer, offering 100% spill-proof convenience with just the push of a button. I love how the spout automatically seals when I release the button, ensuring no unwanted spills or drips. The Sip Cleaner feature is another bonus, as it keeps the mouthpiece protected from dirt and grime. 

Carrying the bottle is a breeze with the integrated handle, which swings up and out of the way when not needed. The lid even has a button lock to prevent accidental opens, ensuring my water stays inside the bottle where it belongs. And when it's time to clean it, the top-rack dishwasher-safe design makes it super easy to maintain. 

However, there are some cons to consider. The size can be a bit bulky for some users, making it difficult to fit into smaller cup holders. Additionally, I found that the water bottle requires a bit of force to seal properly, which can be slightly inconvenient at times. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, the Contigo 40 oz. Cortland Water Bottle with Autoseal Lid has been a reliable and convenient companion in my daily hydration journey. Its durable build and impressive features make it an excellent choice for anyone on the go who wants to stay hydrated without worrying about spills or leaks.

The pop-up straw is a game-changer - it makes sipping water super easy, even when you're carrying a load of groceries. Plus, the protective spout cover keeps dirt and germs at bay, ensuring a cleaner drinking experience. 

However, there's a small caveat. If you’re a fan of carbonated drinks, this bottle might not be your best friend.

Another great thing about this bottle is how easy it is to clean. The lid is top-rack dishwasher safe, and there's also a button lock to prevent any accidental spills while it's in my bag.

### [Insulated Contigo Kids Stainless Steel Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

I was skeptical when I first got my hands on the Contigo Kids Stainless Steel Water Bottle. I mean, how innovative can a water bottle be, right? But boy, was I in for a surprise! 

One of the things that really stood out to me is its ease of use. The push of a button and my kids can enjoy a refreshing drink without any fuss. Plus, the spill-proof valve is like a security blanket for parents worried about messy spills. 

Another highlight is the easy-to-clean lid. It's designed to get rid of any nooks and crannies where grime can hide. And the fact that you can take the lid apart for a thorough clean? Genius! 

However, one minor downside is that the bottle itself needs to be hand-washed. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does add an extra step to the cleaning process. 

Overall, this water bottle has made our lives so much easier. It's perfect for school, durable, and best of all, it keeps drinks cold for up to 14 hours! If you're in the market for a new water bottle, look no further than the Contigo Ashland Water Bottle. 


### [Leakproof Contigo Ashland Water Bottle with Push-Button Spout Technology](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-ashland-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-ashland-2-0-24oz-plastic-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-frosted-rose-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-ashland-2-0-24oz-plastic-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-frosted-rose-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Contigo Ashland Plastic Water Bottle a lot lately, and I must say, it's kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, I love the ease of use with its push-button technology for on-the-go drinking, and the leakproof lid has saved me from some serious spills. 

But on the other hand, there can be some issues. The straw mechanism sometimes pops up unexpectedly in my bag, making a mess. And speaking of the straw, the silicone piece that connects it to the lid has a tendency to malfunction after a few months of use, causing the bottle to leak or allowing air into the straw. 

One thing I really appreciate is the integrated carry handle, which makes it so much easier to take this bottle on the go. However, the lid and body are quite bulky, and I find it difficult to clean thoroughly due to the lid's design. 

Overall, while there are some great features with the Contigo Ashland, the issues with the straw mechanism and the bulky design might have me looking for an alternative water bottle in the future.
