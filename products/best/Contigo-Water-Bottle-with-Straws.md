### [Contigo 24 oz Stainless Steel Filter Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-wells-chill-stainless-steel-filter-water-bottle-with-leak-proof-straw-lid-and-replacement-fi-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-wells-chill-stainless-steel-filter-water-bottle-with-leak-proof-straw-lid-and-replacement-fi-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently used the Contigo Wells Chill Stainless Steel Filter Water Bottle to up my hydration game and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The carbon fiber filter technology incorporated into this bottle significantly reduces the chlorine taste and odor in the water, making it much more enjoyable to drink. The leak-proof design has saved me from countless disasters on-the-go, while the stainless steel body ensures my beverages stay chilled all day long. Plus, the integrated handle and one-handed drinking feature make it incredibly convenient for daily use. 

The standout feature, without a doubt, is the removable carbon fiber filter that lasts for 3-5 months (60 gallons). This has significantly reduced my reliance on single-use water bottles, and I estimate that I've saved around 450 plastic bottles since making the switch! The included autospout lid is another favorite, as it allows for easy drinking with minimal effort and seals securely to prevent any spills. The fact that it fits perfectly in most car cup holders is an added bonus. 

There aren't many downsides to this product, but one minor issue I've encountered is that the lid occasionally gets stuck in the closed position, requiring a little more force to open it up. Additionally, the filter could be more clearly labeled with usage instructions and maintenance information. 

Overall, the Contigo Wells Chill Stainless Steel Filter Water Bottle has greatly improved the taste and convenience of my daily hydration routine. If you're in the market for a reusable water bottle with advanced filtering technology, this is definitely worth considering! 


### [Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle and has been a game-changer in my daily life. The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design and color. It's not only attractive but also made with high-quality materials, giving me the assurance of durability. The angled straw is a unique feature that I absolutely love. It allows me to effortlessly sip every last drop of water without tilting the bottle, making it super convenient for on-the-go drinking. 

One of the key highlights of this bottle is its carbon fiber filter technology, which reduces up to 99% of chlorine taste and odor. This has greatly improved the taste of the water, making it more enjoyable to drink. The filter lasts for about 3-5 months, which is quite decent considering its performance. 

The Contigo Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle also impresses with its leakproof design. The no-leak autospout lid ensures that there are no spills in my car or wherever I take it. And when it comes to convenience, the integrated carry handle and one-handed drinking feature make it incredibly easy to carry and use. 

Cleaning the bottle is also a breeze as the lid and body are dishwasher-safe. The filter, however, needs to be rinsed with water only. The SIP CLEANER cover ensures that the drink spout stays protected from dirt and grime. 

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Contigo 24 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle. Its innovative features like the carbon fiber filter technology, angled straw, and no-leak autospout lid make it stand out from other water bottles in the market. It's definitely worth the investment, especially if you're looking for a stylish and functional water bottle that can improve the taste of your water significantly. 


### [Contigo 24 oz. Ashland Water Bottle for Active Lifestyle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-ashland-2-0-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-2-pack-juniper-sake-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-ashland-2-0-water-bottle-with-autospout-lid-2-pack-juniper-sake-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a Contigo Ashland 2.0 Water Bottle with Autospout Lid 2-Pack, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my daily hydration routine. The first thing that struck me about this water bottle was its sleek design. The Juniper and Sake color combination was quite attractive and added a pop of color to my bag. 

One feature that I absolutely love is the push-button AutoSpout technology which makes it incredibly easy to drink from the bottle with just one hand. And the best part? It's leakproof! There's nothing more frustrating than a water bottle that leaks all over your stuff, but this little gem has kept my bag dry and my belongings safe. 

Another standout feature is the spout cover. I'm really impressed by how well it protects the spout from dirt and grime. Plus, the button lock ensures that the spout doesn't accidentally pop up which would inevitably lead to messy situations. 

However, there's one minor issue that I've encountered. The straw can sometimes come loose and cause leakage. This is particularly noticeable when the bottle is tipped on its side or upside down. But don't worry, a quick twist of the screw on the lid usually takes care of it. 

All in all, the Contigo Ashland 2.0 Water Bottle with Autospout Lid has made staying hydrated throughout the day so much easier. Its sleek design, easy-to-use features, and leakproof capabilities make it a top contender in my book. Despite the small straw issue, I give this product a solid 4 out of 5 stars. 


### [24 oz Contigo Insulated Tumbler with Flex Straw](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-24-oz-streeterville-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-tumbler-with-straw-dragon-fruit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-24-oz-streeterville-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-tumbler-with-straw-dragon-fruit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Contigo Stainless Steel Vacuum-Insulated Tumbler with Straw for a few months now, and I can't believe how well it keeps my drinks at their desired temperature. The double insulated walls are the real star here â€“ they do an amazing job of keeping my coffee hot for hours, even if I'm working outside on chilly mornings. The same goes for cold drinks like iced tea or lemonade â€“ they're still icy-cold after several hours in the tumbler. 

Now, let's talk about the splash-proof lid. It has been a game-changer for me in terms of convenience. Before I got my hands on this tumbler, I used to struggle with spillage when taking sips from my old, leak-prone bottle. But this one has completely changed the game. When the lid is closed, I don't need to worry about any splashes when I'm on the go or working from home. 

The nonslip-grip base is another feature that I absolutely love. It ensures that my tumbler stays put on my desk or kitchen counter, even when I accidentally bump into it. Plus, it prevents any unwanted scratches on my surfaces â€“ a definite bonus in my book! 

One thing that I don't particularly enjoy about this product is the straw. While it's comfortable to use and does allow for easy sipping of cold beverages, it doesn't provide a leak-proof seal like I would have preferred. Therefore, I sometimes end up with spillage when carrying the tumbler around with me. However, I should mention that the lid's built-in sipping feature makes up for this shortcoming. 

In conclusion, I must say that the Contigo Stainless Steel Vacuum-Insulated Tumbler with Straw has been an excellent addition to my daily routine. It not only keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature but also offers unmatched convenience and durability. And despite the minor issue with the straw, I'm more than satisfied with the performance of this tumbler and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone in the market for a reliable, high-performing water bottle. 


### [Contigo 32 oz. Fit Autospout Straw Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-32-oz-fit-autospout-straw-water-bottle-licorice-size-32-fl-oz-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-32-oz-fit-autospout-straw-water-bottle-licorice-size-32-fl-oz-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Contigo Fit Water Bottle with Straw has become a staple in my daily routine. I've been using it for a few months now and it's held up exceptionally well despite accidentally knocking it over a few times. The auto-spout feature is incredibly convenient, especially when I'm on the go or working out. It's leak-proof when closed, so I don't have to worry about any spills in my bag. 

The straw design is a welcome change from traditional water bottles, and it's dishwasher safe which makes cleaning a breeze. The black color is sleek and stylish, fitting perfectly with my gym bag or work desk. 

While the bottle is quite large at 32 oz, it's lightweight and easy to carry, even with one hand. The protective cover on the spout keeps it clean and free from germs, which is an added bonus when sharing with others. 

However, there are a few cons to this product. I've noticed that the flow rate can be a bit slow at times, making it difficult to take large gulps of water. Additionally, the auto-spout button can sometimes be sticky, requiring a bit of elbow grease to open or close. 

Overall, the Contigo Fit Water Bottle with Straw is a reliable and convenient option for those looking for a leak-proof, one-handed drinking solution. While it may have some minor flaws, its pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment. 


### [Contigo Jackson 2.0 Leakproof Water Bottle for Easy Hydration](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-32-oz-jackson-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autopop-lid-dragon-fruit-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-32-oz-jackson-2-0-tritan-water-bottle-with-autopop-lid-dragon-fruit-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Contigo 32 oz. Tritan Water Bottle with Autopop Lid in dragon fruit color, and I've been quite impressed with its performance. Its wide-mouth design makes it easy to drink straight from the bottle, even on-the-go, without having to worry about spills or leaks. 

The highlight for me has to be the Autopop Lid technology, which makes it a breeze to open and close the bottle using only one hand. Its button lock ensures that the lid doesn't open accidentally, while the lid cover helps to keep out dirt and grime. 

Another great feature is the integrated carry handle, making it comfortable and easy to carry around with me wherever I go. Plus, the fact that both the lid and 100% BPA-free body are top-rack dishwasher safe means I can easily keep my bottle clean. 

However, there's one part of the bottle that seems a bit less durable - the switch that controls the Autopop Lid. A few users have reported issues with the switch getting stuck or becoming difficult to use after accidentally dropping the bottle. While it's not a major issue, it's something to be aware of when using this product. 

In conclusion, the Contigo 32 oz. Tritan Water Bottle with Autopop Lid is a game-changer for those looking for a convenient and leak-proof way to stay hydrated throughout the day. Its innovative design, easy-to-use lid, and practical features make it an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient water bottle. While the durability of the switch could be improved, the overall performance of this product more than compensates for this minor flaw. 


### [Contigo 32oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle with Filter](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-32-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-dark-ice-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-32-oz-wells-plastic-filter-water-bottle-dark-ice-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Contigo 32 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle in Dark Ice, and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer for me. The carbon fiber filter technology in this bottle reduces up to 99% of chlorine taste and odor, making tap water taste much better. I was always skeptical about drinking tap water, especially when traveling, but this bottle has given me the confidence to do so without worrying about water quality. 

The bottle's leakproof design is another standout feature. It prevents any spills in my car or on my desk, making it incredibly convenient to carry around with me wherever I go. The one-handed drinking design is a lifesaver, especially when I'm driving or at the gym, and the button lock prevents any accidental opening. 

One thing that I love about this bottle is the angled straw, which makes it incredibly easy to sip from. It's also compatible with most car cup holders, making it perfect for long drives. The lid and body are dishwasher-safe, and I just rinse the filter with water, as per the instructions. 

However, I would like to mention a minor con: the filter can make a creaky metal noise while drinking, which can be somewhat off-putting in public places. But, overall, this water bottle has been an amazing addition to my daily life, keeping me hydrated and ensuring that I'm drinking clean and fresh water. 

I would highly recommend the Contigo 32 oz. Wells Plastic Filter Water Bottle to anyone looking for a reliable, leakproof, and eco-friendly water bottle with a built-in filter. It has truly made a positive impact on my daily water consumption and overall health. 


### [Leighton 14 oz. Spill-Proof Tumbler for Kids](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-kids-14-oz-leighton-spill-proof-tumbler-with-straw-2-pack-silly-spaghetti-penguin-plunge-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-kids-14-oz-leighton-spill-proof-tumbler-with-straw-2-pack-silly-spaghetti-penguin-plunge-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a pair of Contigo Kid's 14 oz. Leighton Spill-Proof Tumblers with Straw, and I must say, they have made a significant difference in our home. The uniquely designed straw opened a whole new world of leak-free drinking for my little ones, especially my three-year-old who loves to test the limits of every container he comes across. 

The spill-proof valve has been a game-changer. No longer do I have to worry about stray drops of juice or water making their way onto our floor or furniture. My kids also love the designs - silly spaghetti and penguin plunge are their favorites - adding a fun and colorful touch to their daily routine. 

One particular feature that stands out is the ease of cleaning. The easy-to-clean design comes apart for thorough cleaning and is also top-rack dishwasher safe. This has made cleanup a breeze and ensures that the cups are always fresh and ready to use. 

However, there is one drawback I've noticed: The straw can be slightly difficult to clean. It comes apart into two pieces that need to be washed thoroughly. But I must admit, this is a small inconvenience compared to the numerous benefits these tumblers provide. 

Overall, I am incredibly pleased with my Contigo Kid's 14 oz. Leighton Spill-Proof Tumblers with Straw. They have made life much easier for both me and my kids, and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, spill-proof, and easy-to-use tumbler for their little ones. 


### [Contigo Paw Patrol Kids Cleanable Water Bottle Set](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/contigo-water-bottle-with-straws?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="contigo-paw-patrol-kids-cleanable-water-bottle-with-silicone-straw-and-spill-proof-lid-dishwasher-sa-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/contigo-paw-patrol-kids-cleanable-water-bottle-with-silicone-straw-and-spill-proof-lid-dishwasher-sa-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to test out the Contigo Paw Patrol Kids Cleanable Water Bottle with Silicone Straw and Spill-Proof Lid, Dishwasher Safe, 14oz and I must say, it's a game-changer for little ones on-the-go. 

The first thing that struck me about this water bottle is its design. My son loves the Paw Patrol characters on it, making him feel like a superhero while sipping his water. But it's not just about aesthetics; the functionality of this bottle is where it truly shines. 

The one-hand operation makes it incredibly easy for my son to open and close the bottle without any assistance. Plus, the spill-proof valve ensures that even if he turns it upside down or tosses it around a little, there are no messy leaks to clean up. 

Cleaning this bottle is also a breeze. All parts are dishwasher safe, and the lid can be easily disassembled for thorough cleaning. This means no dirty corners where grime can accumulate. 

However, there's one thing that could be improved upon - insulation. While this bottle does a great job at keeping drinks cold, it could definitely benefit from some added insulation to keep them colder for longer. 

Overall, the Contigo Paw Patrol Kids Cleanable Water Bottle has been a lifesaver when it comes to keeping my son hydrated during our daily adventures. Its easy-to-use design, leak-proof capabilities, and cute Paw Patrol theme make it a must-have product for any parent.

I recently purchased the Contigo Kids Autoseal Trekker Water Bottles for my kids, and I must say, they've been quite a hit! Not just with them, but with me as well. The first thing that caught my attention was the unique design. These bottles come in very fun and appealing colors that my kids absolutely love. Plus, they're super easy to grip for small hands, making it perfect for little ones on the go. 

One of the best features of these bottles is the AUTOSEAL technology. No more messes or spills! This one-touch lid automatically seals between sips, making it leak-proof and perfect for tossing in a bag without worrying about any accidents. However, I did notice that some bottles are easier to open and close than others, which might be frustrating for younger kids. 

The ease of cleaning is another plus. The lid and body are both top-rack dishwasher safe, so keeping these bottles clean and sanitary is a breeze. However, I did find it a bit challenging to reach all the small nooks and crannies of the lid, so thorough cleaning may require a little more effort. 

One downside I experienced was with the bottle not being 100% leak-proof. My son's blue bottle always leaks when it's upside down, even though it shouldn't matter according to the specifications. This issue might not be consistent across all bottles, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. 

Overall, I am quite satisfied with the Contigo Kids Autoseal Trekker Water Bottles. They are great for keeping the kids hydrated and happy while out and about, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others looking for a good leak-proof water bottle for their little ones.
