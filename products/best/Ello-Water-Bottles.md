### [16 oz. BPA-Free Plastic Kids Water Bottle - Dishwasher-Safe and Leak-Proof](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ello-dash-bpa-free-plastic-water-bottle-grey-16-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-dash-bpa-free-plastic-water-bottle-grey-16-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got hold of a pair of Ello Dash water bottles - the ones that are meant to keep kids hydrated on-the-go. These 16oz. wonders have been my constant companions during daily hustle. The ultra-durable Tritan plastic is paired with a silicone sleeve, offering not just a stylish touch but also reducing the chances of breakage. 

The locking one-touch flip lid with its silicone soft spout has been a delight. It helps prevent spills and also keeps the spout clean during transport, a feature I truly appreciate given my clumsy nature. Its perfectly sized format at 16oz. means it fits perfectly in my bag, so I can hydrate easily anywhere I go. 

However, let us not forget that these bottles are certified BPA-free, Phthalates-free, PVC-free, and lead-free. Plus, they are dishwasher-safe, which makes life a lot easier. The only thing to be noted is to not use them for carbonated beverages and avoid freezing them. 

My experience has been largely positive, with friends and family praising the durability and convenience of these bottles. The only minor issue I've encountered is that sometimes, residue from drinks can accumulate under the flip lid, but a bit of careful cleaning should solve that. 

In conclusion, the Ello Dash water bottles have been a great addition to my daily routine. They're perfect for keeping myself and my family hydrated on-the-go, and their sturdy build gives me peace of mind knowing they can withstand a few minor bumps and knocks. A solid recommendation for anyone looking for a reliable, no-fuss water bottle solution! 


### [Ello Campy Insulated Water Bottle with Cork Handle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ello-campy-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-slider-lid-16-ounce-avalon-sea-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-campy-vacuum-insulated-stainless-steel-water-bottle-with-slider-lid-16-ounce-avalon-sea-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Ello Campy Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle daily, and it's been a game-changer. This stylish bottle keeps my beverages hot for six hours with its vacuum insulation. The soft touch cork handle provides comfort and ease when carrying it around, making it perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 

One of the highlights of this bottle is its leak-proof sealing slider lid. No more messes in my bag or on my desk. Another feature I love is that the lid is dishwasher safe, while the vessel should be hand washed. The bottle components are all BPA free, ensuring that your drinks are healthy and safe. 

However, there are some downsides to this product. Some users mentioned that the lids started to leak after a while, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the bottom of the bottle may be too large, causing it not to fit in standard cup holders. 

Despite these minor setbacks, the Ello Campy Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle has been a reliable and attractive choice for my daily needs. Its ability to keep hot beverages hot for extended periods is particularly impressive. So, if you're in the market for a stylish and effective water bottle, I recommend giving this one a try. 


### [Ello 64 oz Hydra Stainless Steel Water Jug - Mauve](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ello-64oz-hydra-stainless-steel-1-2-gallon-jug-mauve-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-64oz-hydra-stainless-steel-1-2-gallon-jug-mauve-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Ello 64oz Hydra is my daily hydration companion, and I've been using it to fuel my active lifestyle. The vacuum insulated stainless steel keeps my water ice cold all day, which is perfect for those hot summer days. I love the leak-proof flip lid and fully-covered FDA food grade silicone straw - it's so convenient to drink from, especially when I'm on-the-go! 

One of the things that stood out to me is how easy it is to clean. The large opening allows me to easily wash the inside and the dishwasher-safe cap and straw make maintaining hygiene effortless. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The handle can be a bit slippery when the bottle is filled to its capacity, making it difficult to hold and drink from. Additionally, the button to open the lid can get a bit tough to press after some time, which could be frustrating for some users. 

Overall, the Ello Hydra is a reliable and efficient water bottle for those looking to stay hydrated throughout the day. With its sleek design and exceptional performance, it's definitely worth considering for your next hydration companion. 


### [Modern Reusable Glass Sipper Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ello-kella-bpa-free-glass-sipper-with-straw-20oz-grey-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-kella-bpa-free-glass-sipper-with-straw-20oz-grey-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid tea drinker, my trusty Ello Kella Glass Sipper has become a staple in my daily life. From the moment I received my bottle, I was captivated by its clean glass design and subtle real cork accent. Not only is the sipper visually appealing, but it has become a hassle-free addition to my daily routine. Its wide mouth opening allows me to easily clean the jar and add ice on hot summer days. 

One standout feature I adore is the friction-fit lid, which secures tightly, preventing any spills or leaks. This makes the glass sipper perfect for use in the car, at work, or during my early morning jogs. Despite its glass construction, the bottle is incredibly sturdy and has withstood a few minor accidents without so much as a crack. 

The silicone grip provides exceptional comfort when holding the bottle, making it enjoyable to use even during extended periods of time. Additionally, the smoothie-approved straw ensures a seamless drinking experience and eliminates any unpleasant aftertaste that sometimes comes with stainless steel water bottles. 

On multiple occasions, I've experienced firsthand how this bottle can effortlessly preserve the taste and temperature of my beverages, enabling me to enjoy a refreshing drink throughout the day. While I initially purchased the bottle for personal use, its exceptional quality and elegant design have inspired me to buy additional ones as gifts for friends and family. 

However, I would be remiss not to mention that the dishwasher-safe claim was a bit misleading, as the lid requires handwashing. This did not, however, dampen my overall satisfaction with the product. 

Overall, the Ello Kella Glass Sipper with Straw is the perfect companion for staying hydrated and reducing plastic waste. Its stunning design, ease of use, and compatibility with a variety of beverages make it an invaluable addition to my daily life. 


### [Stylish, Leak-Proof Water Bottle - Pogo Chug Tritan Plastic](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/ello-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ello-32-ounce-pogo-chug-tritan-plastic-water-bottle-aquaviva-pink-satin-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ello-32-ounce-pogo-chug-tritan-plastic-water-bottle-aquaviva-pink-satin-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a person who's constantly on the go, the Ello 32-Ounce Pogo Chug Water Bottle has been my faithful hydration companion. Its sleek design and sturdy Tritan plastic make it not only stylish but also incredibly durable. I've been using it daily for several months now, and it's kept up with my rigorous routine without showing any signs of wear. 

One of the things that I absolutely love about this bottle is its chug-style lid. It offers a fast, leak-proof hydration experience that has saved me from many wardrobe disasters. Plus, the soft touch carry loop makes it effortless to bring along on my various escapades. 

However, not everything is perfect. While I appreciate the bottle's minimalistic design and easy-to-clean nature, I did find that it lacks in insulation. As a result, I often end up with lukewarm water in the middle of my workout session, which isn't ideal. 

Despite this minor drawback, the Ello Pogo Chug Water Bottle has been an exceptional addition to my daily routine. Its combination of style, durability, and easy usability make it a clear winner in my book. If you're someone who's always on the move and needs a reliable water bottle, this might just be the perfect fit for you too.
