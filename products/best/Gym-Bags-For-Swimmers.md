### [Haven Athletic - The Large Duffel](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="haven-athletic-the-large-duffel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/haven-athletic-the-large-duffel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

While using Haven Athletic's Large Duffel, I felt like I had finally found the perfect carry-all for all my gym essentials. It was designed with powerlifters, bodybuilders, boxers, and triathletes in mind, and it certainly delivers on convenience and organization.

What really stood out to me about this bag was its ability to store items in an accessible and intuitive way. Its visual appeal also added a nice touch, making it a great choice for anyone who views their gym bag as an extension of their personal style. However, one downside could be its size - it may be a bit too large for those who prefer a smaller, more streamlined bag. 

Overall, Haven Athletic's Large Duffel has been a game-changer for me as a fitness enthusiast. Its convenient storage options, size, and visual appeal make it the go-to choice for anyone in need of a reliable and organized gym bag.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="protege-protg-20-inch-collapsible-sport-and-travel-duffel-bag-black-adult-unisex-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/protege-protg-20-inch-collapsible-sport-and-travel-duffel-bag-black-adult-unisex-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Protege 20 inch Collapsible Sport and Travel Duffel Bag and I must say, it's been a game-changer for me. The concept of a bag that can be zipped up flat for storage is incredibly efficient, especially when I'm packing for a vacation or trying to fit an extra bag into my already cramped apartment. 

The material of this duffel is polyester which gives it a lightweight yet sturdy feel. There's even an adjustable and detachable shoulder strap that makes hauling it through the airport or around town a breeze. I also appreciate the side pocket for keeping smaller items like chargers, cables, or my AirPods easily accessible. 

However, one thing I wish could be improved upon is the material itself. It feels a bit thin and not as durable as I would like for something that's going to be constantly packed and unpacked. Additionally, while the bag does have three external zippers, adding an internal zippered pocket would provide even more organizational capabilities. 

But despite these minor drawbacks, the Protege 20 inch Collapsible Sport and Travel Duffel Bag has truly enhanced my travel experience. It's compact, easy to store, and provides ample space for all my essentials when I'm on the go. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient and versatile duffel bag!

### [18'' Blue Protege Duffel Bag for Swimmers](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="protege-duffel-blue-18-in-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/protege-duffel-blue-18-in-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using theProtege Duffel for my daily gym sessions and I must say, this little bag has truly become my workout partner. First off, the construction is top-notch. The 420D rip-stop polyester material ensures durability and strength, perfect for those who are rough on their gear. 

One feature that really stands out for me is the U-shape zipper on the main compartment. It makes packing and unpacking so much easier, especially when I'm in a hurry to get to my workout. The additional front zipper pocket and side mesh pockets add extra storage space without making the bag too bulky. 

The two webbing handles and adjustable detachable strap offer multiple carrying options, fitting perfectly to my preference. However, one thing that could use improvement is the bag's size. Some users have mentioned it being smaller than expected, which might be a downside for those looking for a larger bag. 

That being said, this compact Protege Duffel has won my heart with its lightweight design, ease of cleaning, and overall convenience. It's ideal for anyone who wants a gym bag that doesn't compromise on quality or style. 


### [Deluxe Swim Backpack with Wet/Dry Storage](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="kiefer-deluxe-swim-backpack-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/kiefer-deluxe-swim-backpack-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I first tried out the Kiefer Deluxe Swim Backpack when I needed a bag to carry all my swim gear. I've been using it almost daily for several weeks now, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! 

The first thing that struck me about this bag was its generous storage. Its exterior has three pockets - two zippered side pockets and two mesh pockets, which come in handy for storing smaller items. The main compartment can fit all my swim essentials, both wet and dry. There's even a bonus exterior zipper pocket with an earbud port, making it perfect for those who like to listen to music while they swim. 

One feature I absolutely love is the padded adjustable straps and cushioned back. They provide comfort when carrying the bag, even when it's fully loaded. And speaking of loading, the bag can hold quite a lot! 

However, there are a few things that could be improved. The wet/dry pocket with drainage holes is a great concept, but the plastic material used for the pocket seems a bit flimsy. Additionally, the overall weight of the bag could be reduced for easier carrying. 

In conclusion, the Kiefer Deluxe Swim Backpack is a well-designed product with ample storage space and thoughtful features. Despite some minor drawbacks, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable bag for their swim gear. 


### [Waterproof Mesh Swim Backpack with Drawstring](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/gym-bags-for-swimmers?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek design. It's not just a bag for your swimmies, it's a stylish accessory that goes well with any outfit. I've taken this to the beach, pool, and even on hiking trips, and it's held up beautifully every time. 

The quick-drying mesh front pocket is an absolute lifesaver when you need to access your essentials in a flash, and the drawstring close makes it super easy to pack up and go. Plus, the red and black color scheme gives it a sporty aesthetic thatI absolutely love. 

However, there's one thing that I wish could be improved. The bag isn't designed to be submerged in water, which can be a tad disappointing due to its name. But as long as you're keeping it out of the pool, you're good to go! 

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Athletic Works Waterproof 17L Mesh Swim Backpack to anyone looking for a stylish, convenient, and reliable bag to take to their next beach or pool outing. Its capacity is perfect for all your gear, and its quick-dry mesh front pocket makes it easy to access your essentials. So go ahead, give it a try, and see for yourself how this bag can enhance your aquatic experiences! Just remember to keep it out of the water!
