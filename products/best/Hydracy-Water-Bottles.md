However, I must admit that the size of the bottle might be a bit too large for some people. It took me a few days to get used to holding it, but now that I've adapted, I wouldn't want it any other way. 

All in all, the Orca Hot Pink Hydra bottle is a game-changer when it comes to hydration and insulation. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the market for a new water bottle!
