### [Jade Microfiber Yoga Mat Towel for Hot Yoga and Pilates](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-microfiber-mat-towel-72-raspberry-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-microfiber-mat-towel-72-raspberry-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the Jade Microfiber Yoga Mat Towel in raspberry for my hot yoga sessions, and it has been a game-changer! This soft and lightweight towel absorbs moisture like a sponge, keeping my grip on the mat even during the sweatiest sessions. The material is incredibly plush, giving me the extra comfort I need during prolonged holding of poses. Not to forget, the raspberry color adds a pop of vibrancy to my dull yoga studio. 

The one downside is its slippery texture when wet. It can be a bit challenging to maintain balance during intense poses. However, with a little adjustment, it's manageable and doesn't undermine its other benefits. Additionally, the size might be too large for some, but I appreciate the extra coverage for my mat. 

In conclusion, the Jade Microfiber Yoga Mat Towel is a luxurious addition to my yoga practice. It provides excellent grip and comfort, making it worth the investment. Despite its minor flaws, I would highly recommend this mat towel to fellow yogis seeking to enhance their practice. Just remember to wash it twice before using to remove loose fibers for the best performance! 


### [Jade Yoga Harmony Teal Yoga Mat - 368TE](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-teal-368te-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-teal-368te-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started practicing yoga for its numerous health benefits and one of the essentials I purchased was the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat. This mat has been a game-changer for me as it provides excellent traction and cushioning, making my practice more comfortable and stable. 

The first thing that stood out to me about this mat was its unique design. It comes in various colors, allowing me to choose one that best suits my personality or complements the aesthetic of my home studio. Plus, the fact that it's made from natural rubber adds a touch of eco-friendliness to my practice. 

One feature I really appreciate about the Jade Harmony Mat is its incredible grip. Even during intense, sweaty yoga sessions, I've never experienced any slippage or loss of traction. This has given me the confidence to try more challenging poses without worrying about losing balance. 

On the downside, the Jade Harmony Mat does have a rubber smell when first unpacked, but this dissipates after a few uses and some airing out. Additionally, it's slightly heavier than some other yoga mats on the market, which might be a concern if you plan on carrying it long distances. 

In conclusion, the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat has been a fantastic addition to my yoga practice. Its excellent grip, cushioning, and eco-friendly materials make it worth every penny. While there are minor drawbacks like the initial rubber smell and its weight, these haven't deterred me from enjoying my time on the mat. 


### [Premium 5mm Classic Yoga Mat by Gaiam](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-classic-solid-color-yoga-mat-5mm-cool-mint-05-63619/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I recently got my hands on the Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat (5mm) Cool Mint - 05-63618. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my practice. The mat is lightweight and portable, making it easy to take along with me to classes or just roll out in my living room for a home practice. 

One of the standout features of this yoga mat is its sticky textured surface. As someone who tends to sweat a lot during yoga, I've struggled with slippery mats in the past. But with the Gaiam mat, I can confidently hold poses without worrying about losing my grip. Even when I'm transitioning between poses, the mat stays put and doesn't shift underneath me. 

Another thing I really appreciated about this mat is its thickness. At 5mm, it provides ample cushioning for my joints while still being stable and supportive. It's comfortable to practice on, and I feel much more secure in my alignment during poses like chaturanga or downward dog. 

However, there are a couple of cons to this mat as well. Firstly, it does have a noticeable odor when first unrolled, which is a common issue with PVC mats. Fortunately, as the other reviewers suggested, airing it out and wiping it down with a damp cloth before use helped reduce the smell significantly. 

Secondly, while the mat is technically latex-free and 6P-free PVC, some users may still be sensitive to the materials used. If you have allergies or sensitivities to certain chemicals, it might be worth doing some additional research before purchasing this mat. 

Overall, I've been very happy with the Gaiam Classic Solid Color Yoga Mat. Its sticky surface, comfortable thickness, and lightweight design make it a great choice for both beginner and experienced yogis alike. Just be prepared for a slight odor at first and consider your own sensitivity to certain materials before making your decision. 


### [Yoga Mat with Superior Grip and Cushion](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="prana-verde-yoga-mat-cove-marbled-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/prana-verde-yoga-mat-cove-marbled-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

If you're looking for an eco-friendly yoga mat that's as stylish as it is functional, the prAna Verde Yoga Mat might be the perfect choice for you. This mat boasts a grippy surface that keeps you stable and securely anchored during even the most intense yoga sessions. The beautiful green design is inspired by nature, promoting serenity and focus during your practice. 

One of the best things about this mat is its thickness. At 5mm, it provides ample cushioning to support your joints and keep you comfortable during high-impact poses. Its lightweight design also makes it easy to carry, so you can take your practice anywhere. 

However, one downside to the prAna Verde Yoga Mat is its tendency to attract dust and pet hair. While this can be easily remedied with a quick clean, it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a low-maintenance option. 

Overall, the prAna Verde Yoga Mat is a solid choice for yogis who prioritize sustainability and performance. Its comfortable design and beautiful appearance make it a stylish addition to any yoga routine. Just be prepared to give it a little extra love to keep it free of dust and pet hair. 


### [Jade Harmony Mat: Eco-friendly, Grippy and Comfortable](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-harmony-yoga-mat-68-tibetan-orange-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-harmony-yoga-mat-68-tibetan-orange-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat in Tibetan Orange for a few months now, and I must say it's been a game-changer for my yoga routine. The natural rubber material provides excellent traction, even when I'm sweaty from some intense hot yoga. It's comfortably cushioned, making my joints feel well-supported during those difficult poses. 

One thing that really stands out about this mat is its eco-friendliness. Made without any harmful chemicals like PVC or EVA, I can practice knowing that I'm not damaging the environment. Plus, Jade plants a tree for every mat sold - that's just the kind of company I want to support! 

However, there are a couple of downsides to this mat. Firstly, it's quite heavy due to the rubber construction which isn't ideal if you transport your mat frequently. Secondly, the initial rubber smell can take some time to dissipate. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, making the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat a worthwhile addition to any home or studio practice. 


### [Lomi Fitness Yoga Mat for Pilates & Yoga Home Workouts](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="lomi-fitness-yoga-mat-with-slip-free-material-mint-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lomi-fitness-yoga-mat-with-slip-free-material-mint-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Lomi Fitness Yoga Mat, and I must say it's really upped my home workout game. The slip-free, eco-friendly material is not only comfortable, but also makes my yoga and pilates sessions much more enjoyable. Plus, the 6MM thickness provides just the right amount of cushioning without sacrificing stability. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit too light for some exercises. I've found myself having to weigh down the mat to prevent it from curling up under me. But despite this minor inconvenience, I'm overall quite satisfied with the quality and performance of the Lomi Fitness Yoga Mat. It's definitely worth considering if you're looking for a reliable and comfortable workout mat for your home practice. 


### [Wai Lana Jade Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="wai-lana-productions-125-yogi-mat-jade-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wai-lana-productions-125-yogi-mat-jade-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the WAI Lana Productions 125 Yogi Mat - Jade for a while now, and it's truly been an amazing addition to my daily life. The first thing that struck me was its eye-catching design; I mean, have you seen those beautiful colors? But what's really stood out is its performance. 

The sticky, nonslip surface provides superb traction, which means no more sliding around during my yoga sessions. It also offers great support and stability in poses, particularly important for me since I have sensitive knees. Plus, it's incredibly easy to clean - no more fussing with stubborn stains! 

However, one issue I've noticed is that the mat is relatively heavier than some others I've used. While it's not a deal-breaker, there have been times when I wish it were a bit lighter for transportation. 

In conclusion, the WAI Lana Productions 125 Yogi Mat - Jade has been an excellent choice for my yoga practice. Its comfort, visual appeal, and grip quality are top-notch, despite its weight issue. If you're looking for a reliable yoga mat, I would definitely recommend giving this one a try!

### [Sturdy, Eco-Friendly Jade Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-yoga-mat-midnight-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who got into yoga during the pandemic, I've tried quite a few mats. But none have impressed me as much as the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat. Its natural rubber material is not only eco-friendly but also provides an excellent grip, even when things start to get sweaty. The thickness of the mat offers just the right balance between cushioning and firmness, making it comfortable on my knees without compromising stability. I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - a quick wipe with a damp cloth and it's good to go! While some users have mentioned a strong rubber smell initially, I found it to be relatively mild. All in all, I can confidently say that the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat is worth its price tag. 

However, one aspect that could be improved is the portability. The mat is on the heavier side, which might not be an issue for most people, but if you're frequently carrying it around, this could pose a problem. Additionally, the natural rubber material can attract dust and fur, which might be inconvenient for those with pets. Despite these minor issues, I believe that the Jade Yoga Harmony Yoga Mat is a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-quality, reliable yoga mat. 


### [Natural Organic Cotton Mysore Yoga Rug by Jade](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-rug-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-rug-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Jade Yoga Rug in black for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a game-changer. This natural, organic cotton mat has not only restored my practice to its roots but also enhanced my overall experience. 

One significant difference with this rug is the grip quality. Unlike synthetic mats that can become slippery when wet, the cotton absorbs moisture to provide an unyielding grip. Initially, I didn't find it as comfortable for my hands, but after a few uses, it began to feel more secure and comfortable under pressure. 

Another aspect I adore is the visual appeal of the rug. The color is more green than beige, which I personally prefer. Plus, it's thinner and more compact than traditional mats, making it easier to transport. 

However, there's one issue - it tends to move when placed directly on a slick surface. So, I place it on top of another non-slip mat, and that works perfectly fine. 

Craftsmanship is another highlight. Jade uses natural plant dyes from herbs and spices, giving the rug a unique, earthy appearance. Plus, each rug is handwoven in India, supporting local craftsmen and women. And for every rug sold, Jade provides a needy child in India with a hot lunch for a week, making every purchase a win-win situation. 

In essence, the Jade Yoga Rug in black is the perfect blend of tradition and sustainability. It enhances my yoga practice and adds a touch of authenticity, making it a must-have for any serious yogi. 


### [Reversible Mystic Sky Jade Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-reversible-jade-salutation-yoga-mat-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Get ready to start your yoga journey with the Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat. This high-quality mat is made for those who want a comfortable, supportive, and stylish experience. The PVC material is super durable and the non-slip surface provides an excellent grip during your practice. 

The mat is reversible and features two beautiful designs, so you can switch up your look anytime. At 6mm thick, it offers ample cushioning to protect your knees and joints. I personally love the sun and moon pattern on one side, which helps me stay centered and in balance. 

As for the smell, some users have noted that the mat has a peculiar scent when first opened. I've been using this mat for a few weeks now and found that airing it out in a well-ventilated area for a day or so helps to dissipate any unwanted odors. Plus, I've discovered that using the mat has made yoga even more enjoyable for me, with its increased comfort and support. 

The only downside I've noticed is that the grip quality isn't top-notch for those who sweat a lot. However, once broken in, the mat becomes much less slippery, making it easier to hold poses and maintain stability during practice. 

In conclusion, the Gaiam Reversible Mystic Sky Yoga Mat is a worthy investment for yoga enthusiasts. With its versatile design, excellent cushioning, and adjustable grip, this mat is sure to enhance your practice and promote relaxation and mindfulness. 


### [Jade Mysore Yoga Rug: 27" x 72", Handwoven Cotton, Plant-Based Dyes, Environmentally Conscious](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-organic-cotton-hand-loomed-yoga-rug-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a loyal yoga practitioner, I always sought for a yoga rug that not only felt natural but also offered the perfect grip. When I came across the Jade Yoga Rug Black, it was love at first use! This traditional rug, made of organic cotton, harks back to the original yoga practice. Its length and width are perfect for all yoga styles, even for outdoor sessions on the beach. 

What I particularly love about the Jade Yoga Rug is its hand-woven craftsmanship from India. This rug is not only a testament to the beautiful work of local craftsmen and women, but also a way to support these rural communities. Plus, by purchasing this rug, you're helping Jade provide a hot lunch to needy children in India for a week. 

Speaking of the rug's quality, it's incredibly durable, thanks to its natural plant dyes from herbs and spices like indigo, cumin, and turmeric. While it may feel a bit stiff initially, it softens with use and becomes incredibly comfortable. The grip is exceptional, especially when you're drenched in sweat. 

One aspect that could be improved is the rug's propensity to move slightly when used on a smoother surface. You might need to put something underneath it to keep it firmly in place. 

Overall, the Jade Yoga Rug Black is a fantastic addition to my yoga practice. Its natural materials, exceptional craftsmanship, and eco-friendly packaging make it a truly special product. I look forward to exploring more colors and sharing the magic of this rug with others.

I spent hours and hours on my Wai Lana yoga mat, and it never let me down. The extra thick cushioning makes it incredibly comfortable, even during long sessions. I was initially skeptical about a yoga mat offering too much thickness affecting my balance or comfort, but boy was I wrong! 

The mat's surface provides excellent grip, even when I start to sweat, I don't slip! It even offers great support and stability, especially during certain poses. Plus, it's lightweight, easy to wash, and is latex-free, ensuring it's safe for everyone.

In conclusion, the Wai Lana yoga mat is a fantastic investment. Not only does it provide comfort, support and grip, but it also offers durability and portability. Its easy-to-wash design and sturdy craftsmanship make it a worthwhile purchase for any yoga enthusiast. 


### [Jade Harmony Professional Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jade-yoga-harmony-professional-3-16-yoga-mat-a1375485-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jade-yoga-harmony-professional-3-16-yoga-mat-a1375485-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my daily practice of yoga, I've been using the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional (3 16") yoga mat. This mat has been a game-changer for me, especially when attempting new, challenging poses. With its thick design, I can maintain stability during standing poses and trust that I won't slip during intense sessions. 

The Open cell feature on this yoga mat is a standout, providing excellent traction and ensuring a secure grip throughout my practice. Made from natural rubber, this mat is not only durable but also eco-friendly, containing no PVC or ozone depleting substances. 

One noteworthy aspect of this mat is its thickness. At 3/16", it strikes the perfect balance between providing adequate cushioning for comfort and maintaining a firm surface for advanced poses. Additionally, its dimensions ensure that the mat accommodates practitioners of various heights. 

Caring for the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional mat is easy as well. Hand washing with warm water and mild soap is all it takes to keep this mat in pristine condition. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Some users have reported that the mat tends to attract dust and dirt, which may require additional effort to keep clean. Additionally, the natural rubber scent can be quite strong initially. 

Overall, the Jade Yoga Harmony Professional mat has been a reliable and comfortable companion in my yoga journey. Its unique features, such as the Open cell technology and natural rubber construction, provide an excellent foundation for a successful practice. 


### [Sustainable Classic Blue Yoga Mat by JadeYoga](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jadeyoga-level-one-mat-classic-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jadeyoga-level-one-mat-classic-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember my first time using the JadeYoga Level One Mat Classic Blue for my yoga practice. The grip was amazing, no more sliding around on my mat, but the best part was how cushioned it felt under my body. I felt supported and comfortable during each pose, allowing me to focus on my practice rather than worrying about the mat. 

The mat's natural rubber material made me feel good about not contributing to more plastic waste in the world. The size of 4mm thick, 60cm wide, and 172.7cm long is perfect for beginners like me who are just starting their yoga journey. Plus, knowing this mat is made in the US with eco-friendly materials gives me peace of mind. 

However, one downside I noticed is that the level one mat has a single-pass construction, which means the reinforcing scrim is on the bottom instead of the middle. This could potentially affect the mat's durability over time. And while it's great that JadeYoga donates a tree for every mat sold, I wish there was a way to know exactly how many trees have been planted so far. 

To keep my mat in good condition, I store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and clean it using Jade Yoga's natural yoga mat cleaner. I also avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures and use different areas of the mat to prevent excessive wear and tear. 

Overall, I'm pleased with my JadeYoga Level One Mat Classic Blue. It's perfect for beginners like me who want a quality eco-friendly mat that provides great grip and cushioning. Just make sure to take care of it to ensure its longevity! 


### [Unmatched Durability: JadeYoga Elite S Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="jadeyoga-elite-s-yoga-mat-forest-green-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/jadeyoga-elite-s-yoga-mat-forest-green-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the JadeYoga Elite S Yoga Mat for several months now, and I must say it's been quite an experience. The first thing that caught my attention was its durability; after multiple intense yoga sessions, it still looks like new. The additional firmness provided by the dense top layer really makes a difference, especially during Ashtanga or other vigorous practices. Its smooth surface also offers excellent grip, even when I'm dripping with sweat, which is a major plus for someone like me who tends to get sweaty easily during yoga. 

However, the JadeYoga Elite S Yoga Mat isn't perfect. One issue I've noticed is the strong rubber smell that lingers even after a few uses. While this isn't a deal-breaker, it can be quite noticeable and might take some time to dissipate completely. Additionally, if you're sensitive to strong odors, this might be something to consider. 

Another downside of this mat is its lack of padding. While it provides great support and stability, it can be quite hard on your joints – particularly your knees and elbows. This might not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth mentioning if you have sensitive joints or prefer a softer surface to practice on. 

Overall, I've been pleased with my JadeYoga Elite S Yoga Mat. Its durability, firmness, and grip have greatly improved my yoga practice, making it easier for me to focus on my movements and flow. I just wish the rubber smell would go away sooner, and that it offered a bit more padding for my joints. 


### [Non-Slip Yoga Mat with Nylon Carry Strap - 72" x 24" - 10mm Thick](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-green-73" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-green-73/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat for a few weeks now in my daily workout sessions and I can't help but find it a perfect addition to my fitness routine. The extra-thick foam provides superior comfort and support during any type of floor work, making it a must-have for my daily ab workouts and stretching sessions. 

One thing I particularly love about this mat is the easy-cinch carrying strap that allows me to quickly strap up my mat and go, whether it's to the gym or just for a quick workout session at home. Not to mention, the variety of colors it comes in adds a nice touch of elegance and personalization to my fitness gear. 

However, I have to admit that the mat lacks a little bit of grip when it comes to maintaining traction during more strenuous yoga poses. I found myself using an extra towel to keep myself from sliding around during some of my yoga classes. 

Another minor issue I encountered was the slightly awkward dimensions of the mat. While it does provide ample space for my workouts, it tends to curl up at the edges, which can be a bit of a nuisance. 

Despite these minor setbacks, I would highly recommend the Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat to anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and functional addition to their fitness routine.

I recently purchased the Jade Yoga mat for my travels, and I must say, it has been a game-changer. As an avid yoga enthusiast, I've always struggled to find the perfect balance between portability and comfort. With Jade's lightest mat, however, I've finally found the ideal combination! 

The natural rubber construction provides excellent grip and cushioning, making each practice a breeze even on hard surfaces. I love how easy it is to fold up and tuck into my luggage, ensuring that I can bring my practice with me wherever I go. 

One thing to note is that this mat does have a distinct smell when first used, but after a few practices, the odor fades away. Additionally, I appreciate that JadeYoga is mindful of environmental impact by using renewable rubber sources and planting a tree with every mat sold. 

Another feature that stands out is the mat's durability and resilience. Despite regular use, my Jade Yoga mat still holds up well and retains its grip, ensuring a safe and enjoyable practice every time. 

However, one downside I've noticed is that it's quite heavy due to the rubber material. If you prefer lighter mats or commute often with your yoga gear, JadeYoga's travel version may be more suitable. 

In conclusion, the Jade Yoga travel mat has quickly become my go-to choice for all my on-the-go practices. Its unbeatable grip, comfort, and portability make it worth the investment, even with the added weight. 


### [Jade Harmony Black Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

As a self-proclaimed yoga enthusiast, I've tried several mats, but the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat really stands out. It's not your average yoga mat; this eco-friendly option boasts a natural rubber surface that delivers a brilliant grip. 

I remember the first time I unrolled my black Jade Harmony Yoga Mat for a flow session. The initial smell was reminiscent of fresh rubber, but it dissipated after a couple of uses. The highlight of this mat is undoubtedly its no-slip surface. Whether I'm doing downward dog or trying my hand at more challenging poses, this mat grips onto the floor like nothing I've ever experienced. 

The comfort it provides is another aspect I absolutely love. The slightly cushioned texture takes care of our joints, yet maintains enough firmness to provide stability during more demanding poses. Plus, the thick quality ensures that even when I'm doing seated poses or kneeling, my knees remain protected. 

However, there's a minor drawback - portability. Due to its rubber construction, this mat is heavy. This isn't an issue if you practice at a studio or home, but if your practice involves carrying your mat around frequently, it might be a bit cumbersome. 

In conclusion, the Jade Harmony Yoga Mat truly delivers on its promise of providing exceptional grip and comfort, while also being environmentally friendly. While it may be a little heavy, its many positive aspects make it a must-have for any serious yogi. If you're looking for a new yoga mat, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a try. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider in Jade Yoga Mats

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/jade-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Jade+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Jade Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

When looking to purchase a Jade yoga mat, there are several features that are important to consider. These may vary depending on your personal needs and preferences, but some key factors to keep in mind include: 

* Thickness: The thickness of the mat can greatly affect the level of comfort during your practice. Thinner mats provide less cushioning, while thicker ones offer more support for joints and muscles.

* Sticky Surface: A good quality yoga mat should have a textured surface that prevents slipping and sliding. This is especially important when practicing more intense poses or during hot yoga sessions.

* Eco-friendliness: Jade yoga mats are made from natural rubber, which is a renewable resource and free of harmful chemicals. This makes them an environmentally friendly choice compared to other synthetic materials.


### Consider Your Yoga Style

Different yoga styles require different levels of support and grip from your mat. For example, if you practice power yoga or hot yoga, you may want to prioritize a mat with excellent traction to prevent slipping. On the other hand, if you practice gentle yoga or restorative yoga, a thicker mat might be more comfortable for longer poses. 


### Maintenance and Care

Jade yoga mats are relatively easy to maintain, but it's important to follow proper care instructions to ensure their longevity. After each use, gently wipe down your mat with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could damage the mat's surface. Additionally, store your mat flat or rolled up without any heavy objects on top, as this can strain the material over time.

### Choose the Right Size

Jade yoga mats come in various sizes to accommodate different body types and practice spaces. Standard mats typically measure around 71 inches in length, while extra-length options may extend up to 85 inches. Be sure to measure your available space before making a purchase to ensure a comfortable fit for your practice. 


### Invest in Durability

While Jade yoga mats may initially have a higher price point than some other brands, their natural rubber construction and commitment to quality manufacturing make them a wise investment for long-term use. A well-cared-for Jade mat can last several years, providing consistent support and traction throughout countless yoga sessions.
