### [Lilly Pulitzer 17 oz S'well Bottle - The Groves 1](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/love-island-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/love-island-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="lilly-pulitzer-17-oz-swell-bottle-multi-in-the-groves-1-sz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/lilly-pulitzer-17-oz-swell-bottle-multi-in-the-groves-1-sz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The triple-walled, insulated stainless-steel construction is a real standout feature, enabling me to enjoy ice-cold beverages for 24 hours or piping hot drinks for 12 hours. 

However, I've found that the bottle's durability could use some improvement. Despite being extra careful with it, I've noticed a few scratches and dents after just a couple of months of use. Additionally, the bottle can feel a bit heavy when it's empty, but that's a minor inconvenience compared to the fantastic insulation capabilities.

However, there's always room for improvement. The screw cap wasn't the most secure and occasionally led to minor leakage issues, making it slightly inconvenient when on-the-go. Additionally, the 9.46 ounce capacity didn't last as long as I would have liked during hikes or long workdays. 

Overall, the Cute Water Bottle by POYIPI has been a delightful addition to my daily life. Its cute design, insulation capabilities, and ease of use make it a worthy contender among reusable thermal travel mugs.
