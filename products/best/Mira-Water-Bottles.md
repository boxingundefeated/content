### [Vacuum Insulated Gold Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-wide-mouth-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-harvest-gold-21" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-wide-mouth-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-harvest-gold-21/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The MiiR Wide Mouth bottle has truly been a game changer for me in my daily life. Its design is not only thoughtful but also aesthetically pleasing, with a sleek stainless steel construction that comes in a beautiful Harvest Gold color. The key feature that really stands out is its double wall vacuum insulation, which ensures that my beverages stay hot or cold for hours on end. 

One of my favorite parts about this bottle is its leakproof seal. After an incident where I accidentally knocked my old water bottle over, I've come to appreciating this feature even more. The twist-on lid doesn't allow any spills, so I don't have to worry about any messes in my bag. 

However, there's a minor downside to the bottle. The lid can be tricky to screw back on properly. It often takes me about eight attempts to get it right, which can be frustrating at times. 

Overall, I absolutely love this MiiR Wide Mouth bottle. It's durable, keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature, and saves me from buying disposable water bottles. Highly recommend! 


### [MiiR 23oz Insulated Bottle - Leak-Proof, Durable and Sweat-Free](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-insulated-narrow-mouth-bottle-prismatic-23-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-insulated-narrow-mouth-bottle-prismatic-23-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the 23oz MiiR Insulated Narrow Mouth Bottle in Prismatic for a few weeks now and I must say, it's become a trusty companion on my daily outings. The bottle's minimalist design and easy-carry leak-proof handle make it perfect for people who are always on the go. Plus, the thermal insulation is no joke - your beverages stay cold for 24+ hours or hot for up to 12, making it an ideal choice for both water and coffee lovers alike. 

One thing that really impresses me about this bottle is its double wall vacuum insulation technology. Not only does this keep your beverages at their optimal temperature, but it also prevents the bottle from sweating, leaving no unpleasant water rings on my car's dashboard or cupholder. 

However, there is one aspect that could use some improvement. The screw cap, while leak-proof and effective, is a bit cumbersome and can be a pain if you're trying to take a quick gulp while driving. An alternative top with a flip mechanism would be great! 

Overall, this MiiR bottle has become an integral part of my daily routine. Its high-quality build and excellent insulation capabilities make it a reliable choice for those looking for a stylish and functional bottle. I would definitely recommend it! 


### [Miir Black 27 oz Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-bottle-black-27-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-bottle-black-27-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My journey with the Miir 27 oz water bottle has been nothing short of invigorating. This sleek and lightweight companion has been my trusty go-to for daily hydration needs and adventures alike. I've carried it on many hiking trails, and its minimalist design attracts plenty of envious glances from fellow hikers. 

One thing that's incredibly appealing about this bottle is its 27oz capacity. It's large enough to quench my thirst but not too cumbersome to hamper my mobility throughout the day. Plus, its leak-proof lid ensures I don't have to worry about any unexpected waterfalls in my bag. 

The 18/8 medical-grade stainless steel construction of this water bottle gives it a certain robustness. This ruggedness has proven beneficial when my clumsy hands have accidentally let it fall. Even after several such incidents, there hasn't been any noticeable dent or chip in the colourful powder coat finish. 

However, I must point out that the lid design could do with some improvements. Unfastening it requires a bit of maneuvering, and it isn't as user-friendly as it could be. A one-twist design, much like older models, would make things much easier and less strain-inducing for my wrists. 

In conclusion, the Miir 27 oz water bottle has been an exceptional addition to my daily life. Its durability, sleek design, and leak-proof feature make it a reliable companion on any outing. Despite the minor inconvenience with the lid, this water bottle stands out among others and earns a solid 4.5 stars from me. 


### [Stylish, Durable MiiR Insulated Wide Mouth Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-wide-mouth-bottle-prismatic-20-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-wide-mouth-bottle-prismatic-20-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the pleasure of trying out the MiiR Wide Mouth Bottle Prismatic, and I must say, I've never been more satisfied with a water bottle! First off, the sleek design makes it look more like a fashion accessory than a simple hydration tool. Plus, the Ice cube compatibility means I can enjoy a cold drink even when I'm on the go. 

One of the top features for me was the BPA-free, 18/8 stainless steel construction. No worries about harmful chemicals leaching into my drink! And the threaded lid ensures a leak-free performance - because who wants to deal with messy spills? 

However, there's a very minor downside that I've noticed. To clean the interior, I need a bottle brush, which isn't always convenient. But hey, it's worth it for such a high-quality product! 

What really sets MiiR apart is their commitment to giving back. Each purchase helps fund giving projects at the intersection of communities and the environment. So not only am I getting a reliable and stylish water bottle, but I'm also contributing to positive change in the world. 

In summary, the MiiR Wide Mouth Bottle Prismatic has won me over with its sleek design, excellent functionality, and its contributions to making a better planet. I would highly recommend this bottle to anyone looking to step up their hydration game! 


### [Durable Stainless Steel Mira Vacuum Insulated Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="mira-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mira-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using Mira's Vacuum Insulated Wide Mouth Water Bottle for quite some time now and it has become a reliable hydration companion in my daily routine. The stainless steel body not only looks great but also feels incredibly sturdy, giving me that reassurance that it won't crack or leak. 

One of the features that I absolutely love is the capacity. With the size being just right, I find myself not needing to refill too often. Plus, the insulation is top-notch! My cold drinks stayed chilled even on the hottest day and my coffee remained hot for hours, giving me a lovely warm treat each morning. 

However, I have noticed that the handling could be improved. The rubber handle tends to break easily, which can be quite inconvenient when carrying a heavy, full bottle. Other than that, this bottle has been a reliable daily companion. It's leak-proof, stylish, and most importantly, reliable in keeping my drinks at the desired temperature. Highly recommended! 


### [MiiR Climate+ 20 oz Wide Mouth Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-climate-wide-mouth-bottle-black-20-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-climate-wide-mouth-bottle-black-20-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I received a MiiR Wide Mouth Bottle as a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and he loves it! The size and overall look are perfect. He uses it for coffee on his commute to work and while at job sites, and he's loved it. The wide mouth was the draw to this bottle, and it's been great. 

This Climate Positive bottle is truly unique, boasting 25% less stainless steel, no new plastic, and 110% of its carbon footprint offset. It also features Thermo 3D Double-wall vacuum insulation, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. Plus, it's BPA-free and leak-proof. 

One of the things I appreciate is the large handle that is comfortable and easy to open and close. It's also cup holder compatible and comes with a safe Hardshell Powder Coat finish that preserves its appearance. The Silver Climate+ has a fingerprint-resistant satin finish, which means less smudging. 

The only downside I've noticed is that it can be a bit challenging to clean some of the smaller parts in the lid due to their design, but overall, the quality and performance are top-notch. This bottle has become an essential part of my daily routine, and I wouldn't want to be without it. 


### [MiiR Kids Insulated Water Bottle with Leakproof Straw Lid](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="miir-kids-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-prismatic-12-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/miir-kids-water-bottle-vacuum-insulated-leakproof-stainless-steel-construction-prismatic-12-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently been using this MiiR 12 oz kids water bottle with my little one, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in our daily routine. What I particularly love about this bottle is the leak-proof straw lid, which not only makes it super easy for my child to drink from but also ensures there are no spills or messes. The vacuum insulation technology is a real bonus too. It keeps liquids hot or cold for hours on end, and the bottle doesn't sweat at all - perfect for those hot summer days! Plus, the hardshell powder coat finish gives it a sleek, modern look that both kids and parents will appreciate. 

However, I've noticed that the bottle is a bit tough to clean due to the narrow neck. This may not be a problem for some, but it can be challenging for families like ours who prioritize hygiene. Despite this minor con, I would definitely recommend this bottle to other parents looking for a reliable, leak-proof water bottle for their kids. Its durability and insulation capabilities make it worth the investment, and knowing that we're also supporting a generously-focused business is an added perk. 


### [12 oz MIRA Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Water Bottle with 2 Caps](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="mira-12-oz-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-with-2-caps-thermos-keeps-cold-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mira-12-oz-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-with-2-caps-thermos-keeps-cold-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

You know how sometimes it seems like you've tried every water bottle under the sun, but you still can't find the perfect one? That was me until I got my hands on the Mira Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Hydro Water Bottle. 

I first used it on a hot summer day when I was out for a long hike. I filled it up with icy water in the morning and guess what? My water was still cold when I finished hiking later in the evening. It's amazing how well this bottle can keep things hot or cold, much longer than I ever expected. 

One thing I really liked about the Mira bottle is its size. It's compact enough to fit easily into my bag, but it still has enough capacity to hold enough water or other beverages for a long day out. Plus, the wide mouth feature makes it super easy to clean and even add ice cubes if you want! 

However, there's one con I need to mention. The silicone ring inside the lid can be a bit tricky to clean, but it's not a deal breaker for me. I would still recommend this bottle to anyone looking for a reliable, leak-proof water bottle that keeps drinks at the perfect temperature for hours. 

All in all, using the Mira Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Hydro Water Bottle has been a game changer for me. It's like having a personal assistant who makes sure I always have a cold drink at hand, no matter how hot it gets outside. So if you're in the market for a new water bottle, give the Mira a try - you won't be disappointed! 


### [Vacuum-Insulated Wide Mouth Mira Water Bottle for 40 oz](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="mira-40-oz-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-2-caps-thermos-keeps-cold-for-25" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mira-40-oz-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-wide-mouth-water-bottle-2-caps-thermos-keeps-cold-for-25/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was always on the lookout for a water bottle that could be my perfect companion on my daily adventures. It had to be stylish, sturdy, and most importantly, keep my drinks chill for hours on end. That's when I came across Mira's 40 oz Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Wide Mouth Water Bottle. 

This water bottle is not just another decorative piece for your backpack or gym bag. It's designed with precision and innovation in mind. Its wide mouth makes filling it up with ice or any other beverage a breeze, while its stainless-steel body ensures durability and a good grip. 

One of the standout features of Mira's water bottle is its MiraGuard Technology. This feature enables the bottle to keep your cold drinks cold for up to 24 hours, and your hot drinks hot for as long as 12 hours. I remember filling it up with ice and water before a long hike, and I was pleasantly surprised to find my water still refreshingly cold after hours of sweat-inducing trekking. 

However, every coin has two sides, and Mira's water bottle is no exception. I must admit that the lid could be slightly more user-friendly. More than once, I found myself struggling to open it mid-sip, especially in high-pressure situations like when I'm on a speeding train or amidst a crowded concert. The lid tends to stick on occasions, which can be quite a hassle. 

In conclusion, if you're someone who values practicality and style, this water bottle is definitely worth considering. It's perfect for adventurers looking for a reliable and fashionable companion on their travels. However, be prepared to deal with the minor inconvenience of the lid occasionally. Despite that, Mira's 40 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle gets a thumbs up from me. 


### [Reusable 17 oz Gray Mira Sports Water Bottle](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/mira-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="mira-17-ounce-charcoal-bpa-free-reusable-plastic-sports-tritan-water-bottle-each-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/mira-17-ounce-charcoal-bpa-free-reusable-plastic-sports-tritan-water-bottle-each-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up a Mira 17 Ounce Charcoal BPA-Free & Reusable Plastic Sports Tritan Water Bottle, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. The sleek design and sturdy construction make it perfect for carrying around on the go, whether I'm hiking or running errands. 

One of the things that stood out to me was how effortlessly the bottle held up against frequent use. Its shatter-resistant Tritan material ensures it doesn't crack or chip, even after hundreds of washes. Additionally, the bottle's ability to resist lingering flavors is a lifesaver for those of us who like to switch between different beverages throughout the day. 

However, there's a minor issue with this bottle that I have to mention. While its flip-top lid is excellent for preventing leaks, it can be a bit cumbersome to open and close with one hand. This can be a bit frustrating when you're trying to take a sip on the go. 

All in all, I've been more than satisfied with my Mira water bottle. Its combination of style, durability, and practicality makes it a worthwhile purchase for anyone in need of a reliable beverage companion.
