### [Owala 24 oz. FreeSip Stainless Steel Water Bottle, Arctic Skyfall](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-24-oz-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-24-oz-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="owala-24-oz-freesip-stainless-steel-water-bottle-arctic-skyfall-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/owala-24-oz-freesip-stainless-steel-water-bottle-arctic-skyfall-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Owala 24 oz. FreeSip Stainless Steel Water Bottle for a while now and I must say, it's a game-changer in the world of hydration. This sleek, stainless steel water bottle not only has a captivating design but also keeps your beverages cold for up to 24 hours. 

One thing that immediately caught my attention was the FreeSip lid. It features a built-in straw, which makes sipping a breeze, and also doubles as a chug cap for those days when you just need to quench your thirst quickly. The wide mouth opening is another gem - it makes refilling and cleaning super easy. Plus, the lid flips open with just a button press and locks securely when not in use, making it perfect for on-the-go use. 

The double-wall vacuum insulation is truly remarkable. I can attest that hot drinks stay hot up to 12 hours and cold drinks stay cold throughout the day, even under the scorching summer heat. The vacuum seal is so tight that I can trust my Owala with carrying my morning coffee without worrying about any spills. 

The hinged loop is a thoughtful addition. It flips up for effortless carrying and tucks away neatly when not in use. And guess what? This water bottle fits most cup holders, so you can keep it within reach wherever you go. 

However, there's one downside - you can't use this bottle for hot liquids. As much as I love my coffee, this isn't the bottle for it. Additionally, I wish there were more color options available, as the current ones might not suit everyone's taste. 

In conclusion, the Owala 24 oz. FreeSip Stainless Steel Water Bottle is not just another water bottle. It's a statement piece that adds a touch of class to your everyday routine while keeping you hydrated efficiently. If you're looking for a reliable, stylish and functional water bottle, look no further than the Owala FreeSip.

One of the best aspects of this bottle is its remarkable portability. Fitting snuggly into standard cup holders, it's perfect for on-the-go usage. Not to forget, the wide mouth allows for easy cleaning and adding ice, making it suitable for hot or cold beverages. 

However, it's not without its quirks. After using this bottle extensively, it's worth highlighting that some colors may not be entirely accurate to their images, as a few reviewers have mentioned.

I recently got my hands on the Owala 24 oz Water in the Desert FreeSip Water Bottle, and I must say, it's been a game-changer in my daily routine. The first time I used it, I was instantly sold by the innovative design. 

One of the standout features of this water bottle is the FreeSip spout. It allows me to switch effortlessly between sipping through the integrated straw when I'm on the go or tilt back to take a swig from the wide-mouth spout opening when I'm stationary. This versatility makes it perfect for my daily commute, where I alternate between driving and walking. 

The push-to-open lid is another brilliant feature. It ensures that the straw remains clean at all times, which is important to me because I sometimes use this bottle to carry juice or smoothies. The carry loop also serves as a lock, securing the lid in place, making it an ideal companion during my workout sessions or hiking trips.

I also love the protective push-to-open lid which does a fantastic job of keeping the spout clean. Plus, with the convenient carry loop acting as a lock, I don't have to worry about the bottle accidentally opening in my bag. 

However, there is one minor inconvenience. The cupholder-friendly base might seem like a great feature, but in reality, it isn't as stable as I'd like. Several times, I've noticed the bottle leaning precariously in the cupholder of my car, which is a bit disconcerting. 

Despite this minor flaw, I would still strongly recommend the Owala 24 oz Water Bottles. It's phthalate-free, BPA-free, and comes with a wide opening for easy cleaning and adding ice. Overall, it's a high-quality bottle that provides convenience, functionality, and peace of mind.

### How do I replace the paracord handle on my Owala Water Bottle?

In case you need to replace the paracord handle on your Owala Water Bottle, order a new one from the Owala website, and follow these simple steps: 1. Unscrew the bottom cap of your bottle to gain access to the inside.

2. Remove the old paracord handle by pulling it through the bottom cap and out of the bottle.

3. Thread the new paracord handle through the bottom cap, ensuring the metal ring is positioned on the inside of the cap.

4. Reattach the paracord handle by pulling it up through the bottom of the bottle, ensuring the metal ring passes through the opening in the bottle's bottom cap.

5. Once the paracord handle is through and you have the length adjusted correctly, screw the bottom cap back on.

With these steps, you can easily replace your Owala Water Bottle's paracord handle and continue enjoying its many benefits.
