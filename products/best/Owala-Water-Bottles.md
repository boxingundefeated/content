### [32oz Owala Flip Water Bottle - Insulated Stainless Steel](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="owala-flip-water-bottle-very-very-dark-stainless-steel-32oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/owala-flip-water-bottle-very-very-dark-stainless-steel-32oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this Owala Flip Water Bottle for a few weeks now, and I must say it's been a game-changer in my daily life. The flip straw makes it super convenient to take quick sips on the go, and the vacuum insulated stainless steel keeps my water icy cold for hours. Even when I fill it up at the beginning of a hot summer day, I can still expect chilled water by the time I'm done with my workout. 

The 32 oz capacity means I don't have to constantly refill throughout the day, which is a huge plus. Plus, the leak-proof lid gives me peace of mind knowing I won't be dealing with any spills in my bag or on my workdesk. 

However, one con I've noticed is that the flip straw can be a little tricky to clean thoroughly. Though the lid is dishwasher safe, I've had to resort to hand-cleaning occasionally to ensure everything stays clean and hygienic. 

All in all, if you're looking for a stylish and functional water bottle to keep you hydrated throughout your day, I would definitely recommend giving the Owala Flip a try!

The 32 oz. capacity is perfect for extended outings, and it comfortably fits most cup holders. It's also worth mentioning that this bottle is BPA and phthalate free for your peace of mind.

### [Owala Flip Straw Kids Water Bottle - Pink](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-water-bottles?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/owala-water-bottles?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="owala-kids-flip-water-bottle-pink-18-oz-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/owala-kids-flip-water-bottle-pink-18-oz-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Okay, let me share my personal experience with this colorful and functional Owala Flip Water Bottle. As someone who is always on the go, I was really excited to try this out.

However, on the downside, some reviews mentioned leakage issues. I've not faced this problem myself but it might be something to consider. Another potential drawback could be the insulation. While it keeps my water cool for a while, it doesn't last as long as I'd like on hot summer days. 

Overall, if you're looking for a practical and visually appealing water bottle, the Owala Flip might be worth considering. Just watch out for potential leakage and maybe keep your distance from fizzy drinks!
