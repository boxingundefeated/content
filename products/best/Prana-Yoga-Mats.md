### [Eco-Friendly, Extra Thick TPE Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-performance-solid-lake-24-in-w-x-68-in-l-x-6-mm-tpe-yoga-mat-11-33-sq-ft-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-performance-solid-lake-24-in-w-x-68-in-l-x-6-mm-tpe-yoga-mat-11-33-sq-ft-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam Performance Solid Lake Yoga Mat in Blue, and I've been using it daily for the past couple of weeks. This yoga mat is made of TPE, which is recyclable and biodegradable, and it feels sturdy yet comfortable. 

The highlight of this mat for me is its 6mm thickness, providing ample cushioning and support during my yoga sessions. I also appreciate the closed cell structure that keeps germs and odors at bay. The non-slip surface is another significant feature, ensuring that the mat stays in place even during my most intense sessions. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this mat. Firstly, it takes a little time to get it to lie flat, as the edges tend to curl up a bit. Secondly, although the grip is quite good, I still occasionally experience a bit of slipping, especially if I start to sweat. Despite these issues, I mostly have a positive experience with this yoga mat and would recommend it to others. 

On the whole, the Gaiam Performance Solid Lake Yoga Mat offers comfort, cushioning, and a non-slip surface, making it an ideal choice for yoga enthusiasts like me. Though there are a few minor drawbacks such as the curling edges and occasional slippage, overall, it's a good quality mat that enhances my yoga practice. 


### [Extra-thick 10mm Grippiest Yoga Mat with Carry Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-essentials-thick-yoga-mat-fitness-exercise-mat-with-easy-cinch-yoga-mat-carrier-strap-red-72-i-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat religiously for my daily yoga sessions and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The extra thickness provides unbelievable comfort and support, especially during my intense core workouts. It's like having a personal cushion right beneath me, leaving no room for sore knees or elbows. 

One thing I absolutely adore about this mat is the easy-cinch carrying strap. It makes transporting the mat a breeze, whether I'm throwing it in the car, storing it at home, or bringing it to the gym. Plus, the variety of colors adds a fun, personal touch and keeps things stylish. 

However, there have been a couple of hiccups. Initially, the mat provided excellent grip but as time passed, it started to lose its stickiness, which can be quite frustrating, especially when you're in the middle of a challenging yoga sequence. And while it's an excellent choice for a fitness mat, some yoga poses can lead to stretching and potential tearing, making it less ideal for a strictly yoga practice. 

All in all, if you're looking for a comfortable, colorful, and versatile fitness mat that excels at supporting your body during workouts, the Gaiam Essentials Fitness Mat is definitely worth considering. Just keep in mind that it may not be the best choice for those who heavily rely on their yoga mat's grip for intense sessions. 


### [Stylish and Durable Extra-Large Yoga Mat with Knee Pad, Blocks, and Carrying Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-fitness-71x24-anti-tear-yoga-mat-w-strap-knee-pad-blocks-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I’ve been using the BalanceFrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat for a while now, and I must say it's been a game-changer for my yoga practice. I used to worry about discomfort on my knees and hips during sessions, but since I started using this mat, those issues have been history. 

One feature that really stands out is its high-density foam. It's incredibly comfortable and provides just the right amount of cushioning for my joints. I also love how slip-resistant the mat is. No matter how challenging the pose, I always feel secure in my balance on it. 

The moisture-proof technology is a great addition too. Sweaty yoga mats can be quite a hassle to clean, but with this mat, all I need is some soap and water. Super easy and convenient. 

However, one thing I've noticed is that the mat tends to curl on the edges due to the strap, which can be problematic when trying to maintain a stable position. Despite this minor inconvenience, overall, this yoga mat has definitely improved my yoga experience. It's comfortable, sturdy, and easy to clean. So, if you're in the market for a new yoga mat, the BalanceFrom Fitness 71"x24" Anti Tear Yoga Mat is definitely worth considering. 


### [Gaiam Indigo Point Yoga Mat (6mm)](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-indigo-point-6mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently picked up the Gaiam Premium Print Yoga Mat in Indigo Point, and it's been a game-changer for my home practice. The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful design, which features a subtle point print that adds visual interest while also helping me check my alignment during yoga sessions. 

The mat itself is 6mm thick, providing ample cushioning to support joints and maintain proper alignment during various poses. One of the things I really appreciate about this mat is its commitment to eco-friendliness and health: it's free of harmful chemicals and phthalates, making it a safer choice for both me and the environment. 

However, the initial chemical smell upon unboxing the mat did concern me at first. To address this, I followed Gaiam's suggestion and let the mat air out for 2-3 days before using it. Thankfully, the odor dissipated completely, and I was able to start practicing on it without any issues. 

In terms of usability, this mat has exceeded my expectations. The non-slip surface ensures a secure grip during challenging poses, while the comfortable thickness allows me to practice on hard floors without experiencing discomfort. Additionally, I found the mat easy to clean and maintain, which is a bonus for those who may not have the time or patience for extensive upkeep. 

However, one caveat worth mentioning is the durability of the printed design. I've noticed that some areas of the mat have begun to show signs of wear after only a few weeks of regular use. This might be an issue for those seeking a long-lasting yoga mat. 

All in all, I would highly recommend the Gaiam Premium Print Yoga Mat in Indigo Point to anyone looking to enhance their home practice. Its beautiful design, comfortable thickness, and commitment to eco-friendliness make it a worthwhile investment for both beginners and experienced yogis alike. 


### [Sustainable Eco-Friendly Performance Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-6mm-performance-yoga-fitness-mat-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-6mm-performance-yoga-fitness-mat-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Gaiam Performance Yoga-Fitness Mat in a sleek black is a game-changer for your practice. Made from eco-friendly TPE, this non-toxic, biodegradable, and recyclable mat ensures both sustainability and durability. The closed-cell design seals out odor and bacteria, keeping your mat fresh. Measuring 23.5"W x 68"L and 6mm in thickness, it boasts a non-slip, reversible surface, providing superior cushioning, support, and traction throughout your exercises. Experience the fusion of style, performance, and eco-consciousness with every session. 

In use, this mat has impressed me with its blend of features. The material provides excellent support without compromising on comfort or traction, which has significantly improved my yoga sessions. Even during intense workouts, it stays grippy, ensuring that I can focus on my practice without worrying about slipping. The compact design and adjustable carry string make it incredibly portable, making it an ideal choice for those who prefer to practice on the go. 

However, one downside I found was the mat's weight. While it is not overly heavy, portability can be a bit of a concern, especially during long commutes. Additionally, for those who frequently engage in hot yoga or similar practices where sweating is significant, this mat may become slightly slippery due to its lack of soak-up ability. 

All in all, the Gaiam Performance Yoga-Fitness Mat in a sleek black is a fantastic choice for yoga enthusiasts and fitness enthusiasts alike. Its high quality materials, comfortable thickness, and superior grip make it a must-have for your home practice space. Despite its minor drawbacks, this mat has significantly enhanced my practice experience, leaving me eager to continue using it. 


### [Wai Lana Blue Pilates & Yoga Mat with Peacock Design](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/wai-lana-himalaya-yoga-pilates-mat-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a fitness enthusiast always on the lookout for new workout gear, I recently stumbled upon the WAI Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat in Blue. From the moment I unrolled it, I was captivated by its majestic peacock design on the surface. It was an instant addition to my home workout space, as it brought a level of excitement and elegance to my practice that I hadn't experienced before. 

One thing that really stood out was the lightweight, easy-to-wash design. It's easy to roll up and transport, making it perfect for those who love to practice yoga or Pilates on-the-go. Not only that, but the optimal cushioning provided a comfortable base for my sessions, which was especially helpful during long poses and postures. 

The smooth, yet grippy surface is another feature that really impressed me. Even when I'm drenched in sweat, the mat remains grippy and non-slip, giving me peace of mind and confidence during my workout. 

However, there is one aspect of the mat that I found a little challenging. Given its thickness, I sometimes feel slightly disconnected from the ground, which can make balance-intensive poses more difficult. Nonetheless, this minor inconvenience is outweighed by the numerous benefits and comfort provided by the WAI Lana mat. 

Overall, the WAI Lana Himalaya Yoga & Pilates Mat is a stylish and comfortable addition to any fitness enthusiast's workout gear. Its beautiful design, combined with its lightweight, easy-to-wash design, optimal cushioning, and grippy surface make it a top contender for anyone looking to level up their home workout space. 


### [All Purpose Premium Exercise Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-go-yoga-all-purpose-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-go-yoga-all-purpose-anti-tear-exercise-yoga-mat-with-carrying-strap-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a yoga enthusiast, I've always struggled with finding the perfect balance between comfort and portability when it comes to yoga mats. That's why the Balance From All Purpose Premium Yoga Mat caught my eye. Its promise of double-sided non-slip surfaces appealed to me since it reduces the chance of injuries. 

In practice, the mat lives up to its claims. The exceptional resilience did help me keep my balance during various exercise styles. It's a relief to work out on a surface that doesn't slip or slide with every move, and the moisture-resistant technology sure makes it easy to wash! 

The ease of transport was another bonus. With its light weight and easy strapping feature, I can carry this mat anywhere without fuss. Dimensions-wise, the mat is spacious enough to accommodate users of different shapes and sizes - absolutely comforting when I'm trying to hold certain poses. 

However, there was one minor issue that needs addressing. While the high-density foam is indeed comfortable, it tends to slide a bit on certain floor types - especially tiles. It can be a little annoying at times, but manageable with some adjustments. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Balance From All Purpose Premium Yoga Mat. It provides the comfort and stability needed for my yoga sessions, and the portability factor makes it perfect for those who prefer to practice indoors and outdoors. Despite its minor sliding issue, I'd still recommend this mat to fellow yogis. 


### [5mm Classic Yoga Mat, Mulberry](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-solid-color-yoga-mat-mulberry-5mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-solid-color-yoga-mat-mulberry-5mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Gaiam Solid Color Yoga Mat in Mulberry, and I must say it's been a game-changer for my home yoga practice. The 5mm cushioning provides just the right amount of support for my knees and hips during poses like downward dog, while the sticky surface keeps me grounded throughout my session. 

One thing that stood out to me was the access to Gaiam's online library of exclusive yoga content, which has helped me explore new poses and expand my practice. Plus, the mat's lightweight design makes it easy to carry from room to room or even take with me when I'm traveling. 

However, there are a few cons to consider. Some users have reported a strong chemical odor upon unboxing the mat, although airing it out and wiping it down with a damp cloth can help alleviate this issue. Additionally, some users have experienced slipping on the mat during intense sweat sessions, so it may not be ideal for those who tend to get sweaty during their practice. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Gaiam Solid Color Yoga Mat for anyone looking to enhance their home yoga practice with a comfortable, durable, and visually appealing mat. Just remember to give it a good cleaning before use and keep an eye on your grip if you're prone to sweating during practice. 


### [Extra Thick Yoga Mat with Non-Slip Surface and Carrying Strap](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="balancefrom-go-yoga-all-purpose-anti-tear-exercise-mat-with-carrying-strap-green-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/balancefrom-go-yoga-all-purpose-anti-tear-exercise-mat-with-carrying-strap-green-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I decided to give yoga a try after hearing so many great things about it. I was a little nervous since I've never done any kind of exercise in my life, but I was determined to give it a shot. I bought the Balancefrom Go Yoga All Purpose Anti-Tear Exercise Mat with Carrying Strap in green because I wanted something that would provide good cushioning and be easy to carry around. 

The first thing that stood out to me was how thick the mat is. At 1.3cm, it's definitely not your average yoga mat. I thought it might be too bulky or heavy to carry around, but I was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight it is. The carrying strap included with the mat is a nice bonus, making it easy to take with me wherever I go. 

In terms of comfort, this mat truly delivers. Its thickness provides ample cushioning for my joints during various poses without sacrificing stability or balance. The non-slip traction on both sides of the mat is also excellent, helping me maintain my grip even during sweaty sessions. 

One feature that I appreciated was how easy it is to clean. The moisture-resistant technology means I can quickly wipe it down with soap and water after use. It dries relatively quickly too, so I don't have to worry about leaving it out overnight. 

However, there are some downsides to this mat. For one, its thickness makes it a bit more difficult to roll up tightly for storage. Additionally, I've noticed that the material can tear easily if not handled carefully. 

Overall, I've had a positive experience with this yoga mat. Its comfort, stability, and ease of use make it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced yogis alike. While it does have some drawbacks, such as potential tearing and difficulty in rolling up for storage, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for me. 


### [Gaiam Foldable Yoga Mat: Attractive, Durable, and Portable](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-foldable-yoga-mat-2mm-icy-paisley-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-foldable-yoga-mat-2mm-icy-paisley-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a dedicated yoga enthusiast, I've tried my fair share of yoga mats over the years. But when I came across the Gaiam Foldable Yoga Mat in Icy Paisley, I knew I had stumbled upon a real game-changer. This compact, lightweight mat has not only made my practice more convenient but also added a touch of elegance to it. 

One of the first things I noticed about this mat is its unique scoring pattern. Unlike traditional mats that need to be rolled up, this one folds into a small, manageable square. It's perfect for the girl-on-the-go like me who loves to practice yoga wherever she is. Whether it's a trip to Mexico or a weekend getaway, this mat has been my constant companion. 

Another feature that truly stood out is its non-slip surface. Even when I'm practicing on slippery tiles or hardwood floors, I never have to worry about losing my grip. The sticky texture of the mat ensures that I remain stable and balanced throughout my practice, no matter how intense it gets. 

However, one thing to keep in mind about this mat is its thickness. At just 2mm, it may not provide as much cushioning as some thicker mats. But for those who prioritize portability and convenience, the trade-off is well worth it. Plus, if you have sensitive knees like me, you can always use a towel for extra padding. 

All in all, I couldn't be happier with my Gaiam Foldable Yoga Mat. It's not only stylish and easy to carry but also offers excellent grip and stability. If you're a fellow traveler or simply someone who prefers a more minimalistic approach to yoga, I highly recommend giving this mat a try. 


### [prAna Verde Yoga Mat - Green](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="prana-verde-yoga-mat-glogg-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/prana-verde-yoga-mat-glogg-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The prAna Verde Yoga Mat is a workout enthusiast's best friend. As someone who regularly practices yoga, I was drawn to this mat for its eco-friendly design and high-quality materials. Upon receiving the mat, it was clear that this was not just another yoga accessory. The Verde Yoga Mat boasts a grippy anti-slip surface that prevents sliding and falling during even the most intense sessions. 

One of the most noticeable features of this mat is its unique, vibrant green coloring. Inspired by nature, the design enhances the tranquil ambiance of a yoga studio and helps focus on achieving balance and wellness. I appreciate how easy it is to roll up and carry with me when I head outside to practice. However, given that it's made from 100% FSC Rubber, it can be quite heavy - making it less ideal for travel or frequent studio usage. 

On the downside, I found the mat quite difficult to clean. Loose hairs and dust stuck to the surface, making it look dirty even after wiping it down. Additionally, some users reported an unpleasant odor coming from the material, though I personally haven't experienced this issue. 

As someone who prioritizes sustainability and comfort in their workout gear, the prAna Verde Yoga Mat ticks many boxes. Its eco-friendly design and high-quality components promise years of reliable use, making it a worthy investment for any yoga enthusiast. Despite a few minor drawbacks such as the difficulty in cleaning and the heavy weight, I'm overall delighted with my purchase and have no hesitation recommending it to others. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider When Buying Prana Yoga Mats

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Prana+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Prana Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

Yoga mats are essential tools for practitioners at all levels. When considering a Prana yoga mat, there are several features to keep in mind: 

* Thickness: A good yoga mat should provide adequate cushioning to protect your joints during practice. Look for mats that are at least 3mm thick for optimal comfort and support.

* Material: Prana offers a variety of material options, including natural rubber, jute, and polyurethane. Each has its own unique benefits in terms of grip, durability, and eco-friendliness.

* Tread Pattern: The tread pattern on a yoga mat affects its grip and stability. A well-designed pattern can help prevent slipping during practice while providing traction for various poses.


### Considerations for Choosing the Right Prana Yoga Mat

Before making a purchase decision, think about the following factors: 

* Usage: Consider your intended use for the mat. Are you looking for a mat primarily for home practice or will you be traveling with it? This will help you determine the right size and portability features.

* Environment: Think about where you'll be using the mat most often. If you practice outdoors, opt for a mat that can handle different terrains and weather conditions.

* Budget: Prana yoga mats come in a range of prices, so determine how much you're willing to spend on a quality mat.


### General Advice for Caring for Your Prana Yoga Mat

To ensure the longevity and functionality of your Prana yoga mat, follow these care tips: 

* Clean regularly: Wipe down your mat after each use with a damp cloth and mild detergent. For deeper cleaning, use a yoga mat cleaner or mix equal parts water and white vinegar and gently scrub the surface.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/prana-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Prana+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Prana Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

Consider factors such as your preferred yoga style, personal comfort levels, and the surface or environment where you'll be practicing.

### Do Prana yoga mats have a strong odor?

Some natural rubber mats, including those from Prana, may have a noticeable odor when new. This is due to the rubber's natural compounds. However, the odor generally dissipates over time with regular use and airing out. If you're sensitive to smells, consider airing out your mat for a few days before using it, or opt for a mat with an odor-neutralizing feature, such as the E. C. O. Lite Yoga Mat.
