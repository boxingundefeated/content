### [Bigfoot 100lb Kettlebell by Onnit](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-kettlebells?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/onnit-primal-bell-bigfoot-90lb-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Meet the Bigfoot kettlebell, the newest addition to my workout routine. This 90-pound beast has become a staple in my home gym, and it's not for the faint-hearted. The first thing I noticed about it was its undeniable appeal. The design is simply striking, featuring a hairy, savage Sasquatch on the front that never fails to inspire me. 

In terms of performance, this kettlebell truly delivers. Its impressive 90-pound weight has pushed me to my limits, helping me build strength and endurance faster than ever before. Plus, the solid construction and sturdy build ensure that it can withstand even the most intense workout sessions. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. Firstly, the handle width is a little too narrow for comfort during certain exercises, which can make the grip uncomfortable after a while. Secondly, the intricate design on the handle can sometimes feel sharp against my hands, especially when they're covered in sweat. 

All in all, the Bigfoot kettlebell is a standout addition to my workout gear. It's well-made, striking in appearance, and it consistently challenges me to push myself harder. While there are some minor inconveniences that come with its unique design, they're definitely outweighed by its many benefits. If you're looking for a new, exciting way to get in shape, this kettlebell is definitely worth considering.
