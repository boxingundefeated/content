### [Durable and Versatile AIREX Calyana Prime Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/airex-exercise-mat-calyana-prime-yoga-purple-26-x-73-x-0-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid yoga enthusiast, I've tried a multitude of yoga mats over the years. However, when I got my hands on the Calyana Prime Yoga Air-Tech Exercise Mat by AIREX, it really stood out for me. The first thing that caught my attention was the excellent grip it provides. No more sliding and losing balance during difficult poses. I've used it on various floor surfaces, and it performs beautifully each time. 

The mat's closed-cell foam structure is super comfortable, providing ample cushioning without compromising on firmness. This has been a boon for my practice, especially during intense sessions that require a lot of floor work. Moreover, it's incredibly lightweight, making it easy to carry around, whether it's from room to room or even outside for outdoor practice, which is something I started doing more during the pandemic. 

The Calyana Prime has an attractive design that adds a touch of aesthetic charm to any space. It's not just about function but also about looking good. Its spacious dimensions allow for unrestricted movement during practice, enabling me to explore a wider range of poses without feeling cramped up. 

However, one minor drawback I noticed is that it might require a bit more effort to roll up after use, primarily due to the density of the foam. But considering all the benefits it offers, I believe this con is relatively minor and manageable. 

In conclusion, the Calyana Prime Yoga Air-Tech Exercise Mat by AIREX is an exceptional product that has significantly improved my yoga practice. Its unmatched grip, comfort, visual appeal, and durability make it a must-have for any serious yogi or fitness enthusiast. 


### [Thick and Supportive Yoga Mat in Violet Haze](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="retrospec-solana-yoga-mat-in-violet-haze-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/retrospec-solana-yoga-mat-in-violet-haze-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Retrospec Solana Yoga Mat in Violet Haze for a while now, and I must say, this mat has completely changed my yoga game. The first thing that stood out to me was how incredibly comfortable it is. Its 1/2" thickness provides excellent cushioning, making it super easy on my knees, hips, and hands during practice. I no longer experience the discomfort I used to feel with thinner mats, which is a huge plus. 

The second feature that truly impressed me was the non-slip surface. With some mats, I'd constantly be sliding around, especially during more intense sessions. However, the Solana's non-slip material keeps me stable and balanced, allowing me to focus entirely on my practice without worrying about falling or getting injured. 

However, there are a few downsides to this mat. After a few yoga classes, I noticed that it lacks durability. There are deep dents in the mat that haven't sprung back, causing it to be thinner than when I first got it. Additionally, the grip could be better. During more intense sessions, the mat tends to slide around the floor, which can be quite frustrating. 

On the positive side, the Solana is incredibly easy to clean. I simply use a mild soap and water blend, wipe it down, and hang it to dry. This ensures that my mat stays fresh and odor-free for my next workout. 

In conclusion, the Retrospec Solana Yoga Mat in Violet Haze has definitely made a difference in my yoga practice. Its comfort, non-slip surface, and ease of cleaning are all significant upsides. However, the lack of durability and grip could be improved upon. Overall, I would recommend this mat to anyone looking for a comfortable and stable yoga surface, but be aware of its potential shortcomings. 


### [Purple Mandala Yoga Mat by Gaiam](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-mandala-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-premium-print-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-mandala-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Gaiam Premium Purple Mandala Yoga Mat in my home studio, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful mandala design, which adds a touch of elegance to my practice. 

One of the standout features of this mat is its thickness. At 6mm, it provides ample cushioning for my joints, making it comfortable to maintain those longer, more challenging poses. Additionally, the textured surface offers excellent grip, ensuring that I remain stable throughout my practice. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Some users have reported an initial strong chemical odor, which can be off-putting. Fortunately, this dissipates relatively quickly with proper airing out. There's also the matter of durability, as some reviewers have experienced shedding and flaking after prolonged use. 

Overall, I would recommend the Gaiam Premium Purple Mandala Yoga Mat for anyone looking to enhance their home practice with a stylish and comfortable option. While there are some minor issues to be aware of, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. So if you're in the market for a new yoga mat, consider giving this one a try – it may just become your new go-to mat for home or studio use. 


### [Gaiam 5mm Performance Dry-Grip Yoga Mat in Purple](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="gaiam-performance-dry-grip-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gaiam-performance-dry-grip-yoga-mat-5mm-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Gaiam Performance Dry-Grip Yoga Mat (5mm) Purple is my go-to mat for hot yoga sessions. I was initially drawn to its vibrant and attractive purple color, but the real magic lies in its grip-enhancing technology. The topcoat wicks away moisture and offers better grip as temperatures rise during my practice. Not only does this provide me with peace of mind about slipping, but it also allows me to focus on my posture and go deeper into my practice. 

One aspect of this mat that I particularly appreciate is its commitment to health and sustainability. Manufactured without the top six most harmful phthalates, this mat is a healthy choice for both me and the environment. Its eco-friendly nature is evident in the materials used, such as the unique PVC material that seals out germs, odor, and bacteria, making it perfect for those with latex sensitivities. 

However, one issue I've encountered is that the mat tends to wear out more quickly than I'd like. The surface material can rub off after repeated use, which may be unsightly and might potentially stain light-colored clothing. Additionally, some users have reported a heavier weight than expected, which could be a drawback for those who prioritize portability. 

Despite these minor setbacks, I believe the Gaiam Performance Dry-Grip Yoga Mat (5mm) Purple is a valuable addition to my hot yoga practice. Its excellent grip in high-temperature environments, combined with its eco-friendly design, make it a solid choice for both new and experienced yogis alike. 


### [Purple S&S Tapas Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="ss-tapas-yoga-mat-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ss-tapas-yoga-mat-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I unrolled the S&S Tapas Yoga Mat, I was instantly drawn to the vibrant shade of purple. It's lightweight and easy to carry, which is perfect for my daily yoga routine. The mat has a nice grip on hard floors, ensuring a stable and non-slip surface no matter how vigorous the workout gets. I also really appreciate how it rolls up neatly with the included strap for easy storage and transportation. 

One thing I wish was different about this mat is the thickness. At just 1/8 inch, it doesn't provide as much cushioning as some other yoga mats on the market. However, this hasn't been a major issue for me as I mostly practice yoga at home where the floor isn't too hard. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the S&S Tapas Yoga Mat. It's durable, offers great grip, and rolls up easily for storage and transport. While it might not be the most cushioned mat available, its other qualities make it a worthwhile choice. 


### [Purple Classic Yoga Mat](https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm\_source=boxingundefeated&utm\_medium=organic&utm\_campaign=cfpages)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img alt="yoga-direct-standard-yoga-mat-purple-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/yoga-direct-standard-yoga-mat-purple-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the "Yoga Direct Classic Yoga Mat" for a few months now and I absolutely love it. This mat is perfect for my home practice sessions as well as for taking it to classes, and it's even light enough to travel with. The latex-free foam feels really comfortable under my hands and feet, and it's incredibly durable - no signs of wear even after several uses! 

One of the standout features of this mat is its sticky texture. It may seem a little strange at first, but trust me, it keeps me from sliding around during more intense poses, which is definitely a plus. The availability in various colors, including the lovely purple that I have, also makes it easy to find one that matches your personal style. 

However, there's one minor issue that I've noticed. Even though this mat is easy to clean, it does tend to absorb some moisture and can leave a slightly lingering odor after use. But overall, if you're looking for an affordable, versatile yoga mat that will last you through countless sessions, the "Yoga Direct Classic Yoga Mat" is definitely worth considering! 


## Buyer's Guide


### Important Features to Consider

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple+Yoga+Mats-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Purple Yoga Mats-2"></a></div>

When shopping for a purple yoga mat, there are several important features to keep in mind. First, consider the thickness of the mat. You'll find mats ranging from 1/16" up to 1/4". If you want more cushioning and comfort during your practice, opt for a thicker mat. However, if you need something lightweight and easy to carry, a thinner mat may be more suitable. 

Another key feature is material. The most common materials used for yoga mats include PVC, TPE, and rubber. Each has its benefits and drawbacks, so it's essential to choose based on your personal needs and preferences. 


### Considerations for Purple Yoga Mats

While the color of your mat might seem like a minor concern, purple has specific connotations that could affect your practice. Purple is often associated with creativity, spirituality, and calmness. If these values align with your personal goals or the intention of your practice, a purple yoga mat could be the right choice for you. 

Additionally, consider the size of the mat. Standard sizes are typically 68" long by 24" wide, but you can find larger and smaller options available depending on your height and needs. 


### General Advice for Purchasing a Purple Yoga Mat

Before making a purchase, be sure to read online reviews and check the return policy of the store or website where you're buying from. This will help ensure you get a quality product that meets your needs. 

Furthermore, it's worthwhile to try out mats in person before buying one. Most stores allow customers to test out items before purchasing, so take advantage of this opportunity to see how the mat feels under your hands and feet, and whether it provides enough traction during your practice.

## FAQ


### 1. What is the difference between a purple yoga mat and a regular yoga mat?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple+Yoga+Mats-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Purple Yoga Mats-4"></a></div>

A purple yoga mat is primarily distinguished by its color, which is different from the standard black, gray, or white mats. Apart from the color, a purple yoga mat may also feature a unique design or texture that sets it apart from regular mats. Some may provide additional grip or cushioning for enhanced comfort during practice. 


### 2. Are purple yoga mats suitable for beginners?

Yes, purple yoga mats are suitable for beginners. They offer similar benefits to regular yoga mats, providing grip, cushioning, and stability during practice. However, beginners should choose a mat that is easy to clean, comfortable, and has a durable surface. Always consider personal preferences when selecting a yoga mat, regardless of its color. 


### 3. Can I use a purple yoga mat for other types of exercise?

While a purple yoga mat is primarily designed for yoga practice, many people find it suitable for other low-impact exercises like Pilates, stretching, or floor-based workout routines. However, ensure that the mat offers adequate grip and cushioning for your chosen activity, as some mats may not be ideal for high-intensity workouts. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple+Yoga+Mats-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Purple Yoga Mats-5"></a></div>


### 4. How do I clean a purple yoga mat?

To clean a purple yoga mat, first remove any loose dirt or debris by gently shaking it out. Next, mix a solution of warm water with a few drops of gentle detergent or yoga mat cleaner. Dampen a soft cloth with the solution and gently wipe down the mat's surface, focusing on areas prone to accumulating sweat or oil. Avoid soaking the mat, as excessive moisture can cause damage. After washing, wipe the mat with a clean, damp cloth to remove any soap residue. Finally, dry the mat by hanging it or laying it flat in a well-ventilated area until completely dry before rolling or storing it. Always consult the manufacturer's care instructions for specific cleaning recommendations. 


### 5. How thick should a purple yoga mat be?

The ideal thickness for a purple yoga mat may vary depending on individual needs and preferences. A standard yoga mat is usually between 3mm and 5mm thick, providing an appropriate balance between cushioning and stability. Thicker mats can offer additional comfort during longer practices, while thinner mats may provide a better sense of grounding and help improve balance during standing poses. 


### 6. How do I choose the right size for a purple yoga mat?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@boxingundefeated/amazon/purple-yoga-mats?utm_source=boxingundefeated&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=cfpages"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Purple+Yoga+Mats-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Purple Yoga Mats-6"></a></div>

When selecting a purple yoga mat, consider your height and the type of yoga you practice. Standard yoga mat sizes measure around 68 inches (173 cm) in length and 24 inches (61 cm) in width, which may be suitable for individuals up to around 6 feet (183 cm) tall. Taller individuals or those who practice yoga styles that emphasize longer poses may benefit from a longer mat, such as those measuring 72-84 inches (183-213 cm) in length. Additionally, some yoga mats may be available in customizable widths or configurations, providing even more options to suit individual preferences and needs. 


### 7. How do I store a purple yoga mat?

To store a purple yoga mat, first ensure that it is clean and completely dry. Roll the mat tightly, starting from the opposite end of the logo or brand name (if it has one), and place the rolled mat into a designated storage space, like a yoga bag, strap, or simple rolling mechanism. When storing a mat for an extended period, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, excessive heat, or damp environments, as these factors can degrade the material and shorten the mat's lifespan. 


### 8. How long does a purple yoga mat last?

The lifespan of a purple yoga mat depends on several factors, including the quality of the material, frequency of use, and proper care and maintenance. High-quality mats made from durable materials, such as natural rubber or thick PVC, can last several years or more with regular use. In contrast, lower-quality mats or those exposed to harsh elements or improper care may have a shorter lifespan. To extend the life of your purple yoga mat, store it properly, clean it regularly, and follow any specific care instructions provided by the manufacturer. 


### 9. Can a purple yoga mat be washed in a washing machine?

While some yoga mats may be machine-washable, it is advisable to consult the manufacturer's care instructions before attempting to clean your purple yoga mat in a washing machine. In general, it's best to manually clean a yoga mat using a gently detergent or purpose-designed yoga mat cleaner to prevent damage from harsh chemicals, excessive moisture, or agitation during the wash cycle. Always ensure the mat is totally dry before storing it to maintain its longevity and performance.
